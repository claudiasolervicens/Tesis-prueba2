1217;1505;In vivo relationship between pelvis motion and deep fascia displacement of the medial gastrocnemius: anatomical and functional implications;Have Different authors modeled myofascial tissue over a distance connectivity using cadaveric models, but InVivo models are scarce. The aim of study was to esta Evaluate the relationship Between pelvic motion and deep fascia medial gastrocnemius displacement in the (MG). Deep fascia displacement of the MG was EVALUATED through automatic tracking With an ultrasound. Angular variation of the pelvis was Determined by 2D kinematic analysis. The average maximum displacement and pelvic fascia 1,501 +/- 0.78mm Were motion and 6.55 +/- 2.47 degrees, respectively. The result of a simple linear regression Between fascia and pelvic motion displacement for three Executions by 17 task was r = 0.791 Individuals (P <0.001). , Moreover, hamstring flexibility was related to a lower anterior tilt of the pelvis (r = 0.544, P <0.024) and a lower deep fascia displacement of the MG (r = 0.449, P <0.042). These results support the concept of myofascial tissue connectivity over a distance in an invivo model, Reinforce the functional concept of force transmission through synergistic muscle groups, and grant new perspectives for the role of fasciae in Restricting movement in remote zones.;JOURNAL OF ANATOMY;2015;Artículo;Anatomy & morphology;0;fascia;displac;deep;motion;pelvic;;0;0;0;12;6;12;7;26;13

1219;2395;Boron as Testicular Toxicant in Mice (Mus domesticus);It Has Been Reported That causes changes in boron various systems, the male reproductive system Including. Residents in some towns in northern Chile Were consuming a few years ago in the drinking water 20 times more than the amount established as permissible limit by WHO. This study Evaluates the effects in an Animal Model of high intake of boron on the testis. Boron was administered in the drinking water. Twenty male mice (Mus domesticus), sexually mature, Were used, divided into two groups: the experimental group was at a dose Given Boron of 12 mg / L, and the Control group 0.6 mg / L, for 42 days. Sections of testis Were Obtained for: HE staining (Morphometry and Histopathology) Immunohistochemistry (Cox-2), and Picrosirious Mallory stain (tunica albuginea of <U+200B><U+200B>evaluation). The results Indicate That ingestion of a dose of 12 mg Boron / L produces vacuolization, tubular epithelial desquamation and tamponade. Morphometry revealed tubular epithelial height and diameter Decreased and lumen diameter and interstitial Increased area in the exposed group. Immunodetection of COX-2 was positive in a high percentage of tubules in the intoxicated group. The tunica albuginea was thinner, with Decreased percentage of type I collagen fibers and an Increase in the percentage of type III collagen fibers in animals exposed to boron in contrast to the Control group. Exposure to critical levels of boron produces severe histopathological changes in the testis, altering morphometric parameters and Causing overexpression of Cox-2. Finally, evaluation of collagen fibers Boron Suggests That produced a degradation of the tunica albuginea of <U+200B><U+200B>the collagen, Causing a decrease in the thickness of it and altering the percentage ratio Collagen I / III collagen, a process called collagenolysis.;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MORPHOLOGY;2012;Artículo;Anatomy & morphology;0;boron;collagen;percentag;albuginea;caus;;0;0;0;12;6;12;6;23;10

Usually Occur precloacal glands only in evils, but in few species Those Where Both sexes Have precloacal glands, are larger in evils These. Only the morphology and / or histology of precloacal glands of amphisbaenids Have Been described, and it is unknown Whether in lizards These glands differ across ages, sexes and / or species, and if the lack of pores is associated with a lack of glands. We Investigated for the first time the morphology and histology of lizard precloacal Glands, by studying three species Liolaemus That Differ in the presence of pores in Their cloaca: L. irregularis, in adults and juveniles Which of Both Sexes Have pores L. poecilochromus, in Which only adult diseases Have pores, and L. neuquensis, in Which the adults of Both Sexes LACK pores. Results show the number of pores That Varies Among species and sexes, but not between ages of a species. Adults, but not juveniles, of L. irregularis have sexual dimorphism in pore sizes These are larger in evil than in females. In Addition, pores are larger in adult diseases of L. irregularis than in L. poecilochromus. Glands are tubuloalveolar With holocrine secretion, Having a similar structure across Individuals, Have evils, Although adult females and larger glands than juveniles. Finally, the structure of Liolaemus precloacal glands is very similar to Those of the amphisbaenid precloacal femoral glands and the glands of other lizard species. © Firenze University Press.;ACTA HERPETOLOGICA;2014;Artículo;Anatomy & morphology;0;gland;pore;precloac;adult;sex;;0;0;0;12;6;12;6;1;11

As a novel finding, we Observed intense immunostaining, not only in the nucleus of Sertoli cells, but in pachytene spermatocytes Also spermatids and round. The quantitative mRNA expression of DAX-1 and DAX-1A was similarly Between cases and controls and was not associated With the levels of gonadotrophins and steroids. , Moreover, DAX-I transcript expression level was ~ 750-fold higher than DAX-1A, and there was a strong positive Correlation between them (r = 0.52 P <0.001). We close up commercial That, in Addition to Sertoli cells, DAX-1 / DAX-1A is Expressed in germ cells from spermatogonia to round spermatids. Besides, the expression of mRNA like DAX-I and DAX-IA in testicular tissues from cases and controls does not support the Involvement of DAX-1 in the etiology of primary spermatogenic failure. Finally, the low level of expression of the transcriptional alternative variant DAX-1A would not support ITS putative inhibitory function in vivo. © The Author 2011.

1212;3362;Greater prevalence of Y chromosome Q1a3a haplogroup in Y-microdeleted Chilean men: a case-control study;"Purpose: To determine the prevalence of South Amerindian Y chromosome in Chilean Patients With spermatogenic failure and Their association with classical and / or AZFc-partial Y chromosome deletions. Methods: We Studied 400 men, 218 With secretory azo / oligozoospermia (Cases) and 182 controls (116 fertile and / or normozoospermic, and 66 azoospermic With Normal spermatogenesis). After testicular complete characterization (physical evaluation, hormonal and / or biopsy) peripheral blood was drawn to obtener DNA for Y chromosome microdeletions, AZFc-partial deletions and biallelic analysis by allele specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the M3 (rs3894) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Results: Classical AZF microdeletions found in 23 cases Were (Y-microdeleted). AZFc-partial deletions Were Observed in 10 cases (6 \g / g\"", 3 \""b2 / b3\"" and 1 \""b1 / b3\"") and four controls (4 \""g / g\""). The AZFc-partial deletions Were mainly associated With the absence of DAZ1 / DAZ2 (64%). No significant Differences in the prevalence of AZFc-partial deletions Were Observed Between cases and controls. We Observed a significant higher proportion of the Q1a3a haplogroup Y-microdeleted men in Compared to Patients With spermatogenic failure without deletions and control men (P <0.01 and P <0.05, respectively by Bonferroni test). Among them, AZFb Patients With Increased deletions Had an Q1a3a the prevalence of haplogroup Compared to controls, cases without deletions and to Those With complete or partial-AZFc deletions (P <0.01, Bonferroni test). Conclusions: The Q1a3a South Amerindian lineage Seems to Increase the susceptibility to non AZFc microdeletions. On the other hand, in the Chilean population AZFc-partial deletions ( \""gr / gr\"", \""b1 / b3\"" and / or \""b2 / b3\"") does not seem to predispose to severe spermatogenic impairment. © 2 Springer Science + Business Media New York.""";JOURNAL OF ASSISTED REPRODUCTION AND GENETICS;2013;Artículo;Andrology;0;delet;azfc;partial;microdelet;chromosom;;0;0;0;12;6;12;4;15;9
1213;3583;Gold-standard and improved framework for sperm head segmentation;Semen analysis is the first step in the evaluation of an infertile couple. Within esta process, an accurate and objective morphological analysis Becomes more critical as it is based on the correct detection and segmentation of human sperm components. In This paper, we present an improved two-stage framework for detection and segmentation of human sperm head Characteristics (including acrosome and nucleus) That use three different colored spaces. The first stage Detects That defines regions of interest sperm heads, using k-means, then a candidate heads are refined using mathematical morphology. In the second stage, we work on each region of interest to the sperm head Accurately segment as well as nucleus and acrosome, using clustering and histogram statistical analysis techniques. Our proposal is Characterized Also by being fully automatic, Where to user intervention is not required. Our experimental evaluation shows That our method outperforms the Proposed state-of-the-art. This is supported by the results of different evaluation metrics. In Addition, we propose a gold-standard Built with the cooperation of a referent expert in the field, aiming to compare methods for detecting and segmenting sperm cells. Our results Achieve remarkable improvement above 98% in getting the sperm head detection process at the expense of false positives Having Significantly fewer Obtained by the state-of-the-art method. Our results show an accurate head Also, acrosome and nucleus segmentation Achieving over 80% against hand-segmented overlapping gold-standard.

1214;4173;Androgen Receptor Gene CAG and GGN Repeat Polymorphisms in Chilean Men With Primary Severe Spermatogenic Failure;There is ample documentation supporting the fact That androgens are required for the normal spermatogenesis. A minority of infertile men Have abnormal blood testosterone levels or mild androgen receptor mutations. We Investigated the androgen receptor CAG and GGN repeat lengths in Chilean men with spermatogenic impairment. We Studied 117 secretory azoospermic / oligozoospermic men (93 and 24 excryptorchidic idiopathic), without Y-chromosome microdeletions, and 121 controls With Normal spermatogenesis (42 and 79 normozoospermic obstructive men). Peripheral blood was drawn to Obtain DNA for genomic polymerase chain reaction and automated sequencing of CAG and GGN repeats. Testicular characterization studies included hormonal, physical evaluation, and seminal and biopsy analysis. The CAG and GGN polymorphism distributions Were men like Among idiopathic, excryptorchidic men, and controls and different types of Among the spermatogenic impairment. However, the proportion of the 21 allele was CAG Significantly Increased in idiopathic cases Compared To controls (P = 0.012 by Bonferroni test, odds ratio = 2.99, 95% confidence interval, 1.27-7.0) and the AGC 32 allele was only Observed in excryptorchidic Patients (P & lt 0.0002, Bonferroni test). Idiopathic cases With Sertoli cell-only syndrome Showed the highest proportion of the CAG 21 allele (P = 0.024, <U+03C7> 2 test). On the other hand, in idiopathic cases and controls The most common GGN allele was 23, followed by 24, but an inverse relation was found excryptorchidic Among cases. The joint distribution of CAG and GGN in control idiopathic, and excryptorchidic groups did not show an association Between the two allele repeat polymorphisms (P & gt 0.05, <U+03C7> 2 test). Our results Suggest That the CAG 21 allele Seems to Increase the risk of idiopathic Sertoli cell-only syndrome. , Moreover, the GGN 24 allele Could be contributing to androgen receptor function deranged, cryptorchidism and associated With spermatogenic failure.

1215;4177;P450-aromatase activity and expression in human testicular tissues with severe spermatogenic failure;There is evidence impaired spermatogenesis That is Associated With An imbalance in the oestradiol / testosterone ratio and With Leydig cell (LC) dysfunction. In testis, P450-aromatase, encoded by CYP19, is responsible for the conversion of testosterone to oestradiol. The Aims of esta study to quantify CYP19 mRNA Were expression, aromatase activity and protein localization, and to measure the oestradiol to testosterone ratio in testicular tissues of men with spermatogenic impairment. Twenty-four men with complete Sertoli cell-only syndrome (SCOS), focal SCOS 14 With 14 With maturation arrest (MA), 8 with mixed atrophy and the normal spermatogenesis 30 controls With Were subjected to testicular biopsy. All subjects underwent a physical examination, serum hormone and cytogenetic studies. CYP19 mRNA was Quantified testicular using real time RT-PCR. Testicular aromatase activity was 20 Measured using the 3H assay and protein expression using immunohistochemistry was EVALUATED. In cases, serum testosterone and oestradiol Were standard, but the testosterone / LH ratio was lower Compared With controls (p & lt 0.05). Aromatase was localized in the Leydig, Sertoli and germ cells of all tissues, intensity was stronger, Although Observed in LC. Aromatase activity and mRNA Were not altered in cases and correlated positively With LC number (r = 0.516 and r = 0.369 p & lt 0.008). The intratesticular oestradiol / testosterone ratio was elevated (p = 0.005) in complete SCOS Patients Compared With controls. In conclusion, testicular aromatase Seems to be standard in impaired spermatogenesis With MOST subjects. However, an altered Intratesticular oestradiol / testosterone ratio in Patients With complete SCOS some Suggests That is Increased aromatase, Which Might Contribute to Leydig cell dysfunction. © 2 European Academy of Andrology.;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ANDROLOGY;2010;Artículo;Andrology;0;aromatas;testosteron;oestradiol;ratio;testicular;;0;0;0;4;6;4;3;15;30
1216;4410;Histological and hormonal testicular function in oligo/azoospermic infertile men;We Characterized and correlated the histological and hormonal aspects of a cohort of 261 azo / oligozoospermic men, Applying a quantitative / qualitative evaluation of testicular tissue and serum hormone measurements and Intratesticular. One hundred and 93 azo / oligozoospermic Patients diagnosed as Were: complete sertoli cell only syndrome (cSCOS), n = 76 focal SCOS, n = 31 maturation arrest, n = 34 hypospermatogenesis, n = 17 mixed atrophy, n = 25 and severe atrophy, n = 10. Normal spermatogenesis was Observed in 68 infertile men (controls). Patients With cSCOS, focal SCOS, mixed and severe atrophy ADH larger LC / clusters (11.5 11.0 10.7 18.9 LC / cluster) than controls (6 LC / cluster P & lt 0.001). cSCOS, focal SCOS, mixed and severe atrophy Patients HAD higher FSH, LH and lower T / LH ratio serum levels than the other groups. Intratesticular testosterone Concentrations Were higher in tissues With complete or focal SCOS (45.6 ng mg-1 protein) and mixed atrophy (79.0 ng mg-1 protein) than the normal tissues (20.3 ng mg-1 protein P = .03 and P = .007) . Considering all subjects, significant correlations Were found Between T / LH ratio and Leydig cells / cluster (r = 0.510, P & lt 0.001), FSH levels (r = -0692, P & lt 0.001) and With intratesticular testosterone (r = - 0.354, P = 0.001) These correlations follow the pattern of severity of spermatogenic damage. By a thorough histological evaluation, we validate the concept That the severity of spermatogenic impairment is associated with Major morphological and functional disturbance of the Leydig cell compartment. © 2012 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.;ANDROLOGIA;2013;Artículo;Andrology;0;atrophi;sever;cluster;focal;mix;;0;0;0;12;6;12;3;15;39
1203;452;Performance evaluation of paediatric propofol pharmacokinetic models in healthy young children;Background The performance of eight pediatric Currently available pharmacokinetic models propofol target-controlled infusions in (ICTs) was Assessed, healthy children in from 3 to 26 months of age. Methods Forty-one, ASA III children, aged 326 months Were Studied. After the induction of anesthesia generally With sevoflurane and remifentanil, a bolus dose of propofol 2.5 mg kg-1 followed by an infusion of 8 mg kg-1 h-1 was Given. Arterial blood samples Were Collected at 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 60 min post-bolus, at the end of surgery, and at 1, 3, 5, 30, 60, and 120 min after stopping the infusion. Model performance was visually inspected With Measured / Predicted plots. Median performance error (MDPE) and the median absolute performance error (MDAPE) Were Calculated to measure bias and accuracy of each model. Results Performance of the eight models tested differed markedly different stages of the During propofol administration. Most models underestimated propofol concentration 1 min after the bolus dose, suggesting an overestimation of the initial volume of distribution. Six of the eight models tested Were Within the accepted limits of performance (MDPE & lt 20 and MDAPE & lt 30). The model derived by Short and colleagues performed best. Conclusions Our results Suggest That six of the eight models tested perform well in young children. Since MOST models overestimate the initial volume of distribution, the use for TCI Might result in the administration of bolus doses larger than Necessary. © 2011 The Author.;BRITISH JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA;2011;Artículo;Anesthesiology;0;perform;bolus;propofol;children;dose;children;177;0;0.0392635314995563;13;8;12;10;25;33
1204;489;Influence of obesity on propofol pharmacokinetics: derivation of a pharmacokinetic model;Background. The objective of esta study was to Develop a pharmacokinetic (PK) model to characterize the influence of obesity on PK parameters propofol. Methods. Nineteen obese ASA II Undergoing Bariatric Surgery Patients Were Studied. Patients received propofol 2 mg kg-1 dose bolus followed by a 5-20-40-120 min, 10-8-6-5 mg kg-1 h-1 infusion. Arterial blood samples withdrawn at Were 1, 3, 5 min after induction, every 10 to 20 min During propofol infusion, and every 10-30 min for 2 h after stopping the propofol infusion. Blood samples Were processed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Time-concentration data profiles From this study Were pooled data from two other With propofol PK studies available at http: //www.opentci. org. Population PK modeling was performed using non-linear mixed effects model. Results. The study Involved 19 obese adults WHO Contributed 163 observations. The pooled analysis Involved Patients 51 (weight 93 kg sd 24, range 44-160 kg age 46 sd 16 yr, 25-81 yr range BMI 33 kg sd 9 m-2, range 16-52 kg m-2). A three-compartment model was used to investigate propofol PK. An Allometric size model using the total body weight (TBW) was superior to all other models Investigated (linear TBW, fat free mass, lean body weight, fat mass standard) clearance for all parameters. Variability in V2 and Q2 was reduced by a function showing a decrease in age.ConclusionsWe Have Both parameters With a population PK model derived using obese and non-obese PK data to characterize propofol over a wide range of body weights. An Allometric model using TBW as the size descriptor of volumes and clearances was superior to other size descriptors to characterize PK propofol in obese patients. © The Author 2.

1206;857;Respiratory, Neuromuscular, and Cardiovascular Effects of Neosaxitoxin in Isoflurane-Anesthetized Sheep;Background: neosaxitoxin (neoSTX) is a potent site-1 sodium channel blocker being developed-as to the local anesthetic. Doses of 100 ug Have Been used locally by infiltration in Anesthetized adult humans without adverse effect. We hypothesized like deuces That Could cause significant respiratory, neuromuscular, and cardiovascular impairment and to test Sought esta hypothesis in sheep. Methods: Were Procedures approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. In neuromuscular / respiratory experiments, 33 intubated, isoflurane-Anesthetized sheep Were randomized to 6 neoSTX treatment groups: saline control 1 ug / kg subcutaneous (SC), 1 mg / kg intravenous (IV), 2 mg / kg SC, 2 mg / kg SC With bupivacaine 0.25%, and 3 mg / kg SC. Primary Outcome Measures Were doxapram-stimulated volume inspired (VSD) and quantitative limb acceleration. In cardiovascular experiments, eight sheep received escalating doses of IV neoSTX (1, <U+200B><U+200B>2, and 3 .mu.g), with hemodynamic and electrocardiographic measurements. Data Were Analyzed using Repeated-measures analysis of variance Bonferroni post hoc With-corrected comparisons. Results: neoSTX 1 .mu.g / kg IV and SC produced no significant reduction in DSIV or limb acceleration Compared With baseline. NeoSTX 2 mg / kg SC produced clinically mild reduction in twitch and DSIV animals recovered well postoperatively. Coadministration of bupivacaine did not worsen These effects. NeoSTX 3 ug / kg produced severe and prolonged impairment of DSIV and limb acceleration. Escalating doses of IV neoSTX produced mild decrements in heart rate, systemic blood pressure, and systemic vascular resistance cardiac output was maintained. Transient interventricular conduction delay occurred without ventricular ectopy or cardiac arrest. Conclusions: In our sheep model, neuromuscular, respiratory, and cardiovascular effects of neoSTX Were dose dependent and mild Using the dose range for clinical use anticipated.

1200;3651;Association of D16S515 Microsatellite with Specific Language Impairment on Robinson Crusoe Island, an Isolated Chilean Population: A Possible Key to Understanding Language Development;Specific language impairment (SLI) is a developmental language disorder That OCCURS for no known reason. The disorder 2-8% of children Affects. Some scientific evidence Suggests That genetic factors are Implicated in the etiology of SLI. The disorder is genetically complex. Two novel loci on chromosome 16q24 SLI1 (MIM 606711) on chromosome 19q13 and SLI2 (MIM 606712), Have Been found to be highly correlated With SLI. Four genes Have been identified as susceptibility genes. SLI OCCURS at an unusually elevated incidence (35%) Among the population of Robinson Crusoe Island (Chile), Which Also has a high consanguinity rate. This finding supports the influence of genetic Mechanisms in the transmission of SLI based on a founder effect. To investigate further the genetic Involvement in esta population, we Collected blood samples from 13 families from 115 Islanders with a language-impaired proband and from 18 families with a standard-language proband. The analysis of microsatellite marker D16S515, located in locus SLI1, Demonstrated That the 230-bp allele was correlated With SLI and the 232-bp That allele was correlated With standard language development. The domain containing the D16S515 marker, THEREFORE, may play a role in language development. © 2 Wayne State University Press.;HUMAN BIOLOGY;2010;Artículo;Audiology & Speech-Language pathology;0;sli;languag;genet;correl;disord;;0;0;0;12;6;19;4;6;9
1201;3652;Genome-wide analysis of genetic susceptibility to language impairment in an isolated Chilean population;Specific language impairment (SLI) is an unexpected deficit in the acquisition of language skills and Affects Between 5 and 8% of pre-school children. DESPITE ITS prevalence and high heritability, our understanding of the aetiology of esta disorder is only emerging. In This paper, we apply genome-wide techniques to investigate an isolated WHO Chilean population exhibit an Increased frequency of SLI. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) mapping and parametric and non-parametric linkage analyzes That Indicate complex genetic factors are likely to underlie susceptibility to SLI in esta population. Across all analyzes performed, The most consistently Implicated locus on chromosome 7q was. This locus Achieved highly significant linkage under all three non-parametric models (max NPL6.73, P4.0 x 10 11). In Addition, it yielded to HLOD of 1.24 in the recessive parametric linkage analyzes and contained a segment That was homozygous in two AFFECTED Individuals. Further, investigation of esta region Identified a two-SNP haplotype That OCCURS at an Increased frequency in language-impaired Individuals (P0.008). We hypothesise That the linkage regions Identified here, in particular, That on chromosome 7 That May Contain variants underlie the high prevalence of SLI Observed In This isolated population and may be of relevance to other Populations Affected by language impairments. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.;EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS;2011;Artículo;Audiology & Speech-Language pathology;0;languag;linkag;parametr;popul;sli;;0;0;0;12;6;19;4;3;9

1178;455;Size at birth and lipoprotein concentrations in adulthood: two prospective studies in Latin American cities;Background The Relationship Between birth weight and plasma lipoproteins is inconsistent. Aims To ASSESS The Association Between Birth weight and (1) body mass index (BMI) at birth and (2) lipoproteins in young adults, and to explore the possible Also effect of current obesity as a possible effect modifier. Methods Two prospective studies based on representative samples of subjects born in the 1970s Were Carried out in Ribeirao Preto, Brazil (n = 2063) and Limache, Chile (n = 999). The surveys Were Carried out Between 2001 and 2004. Results Mean birth weights 3267 g and 3177 Were g and mean adult BMIs Were 24.3 kg / m2 and 25.8 kg / m2 in the Brazilian and Chilean samples, respectively. Total cholesterol was 4.57 adult mmol / l in Chileans, 0.26 mmol / l higher than in Brazilians (p & lt 0.001). The main finding was an interaction Between adult obesity (BMI 30 or over) and birth weight and BMI at birth and Also low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and overall cholesterol. A birth-weight increment of 1 kg was associated with a decrease in the total cholesterol (-0374 mmol / l, 95% CI -0181 -0567 to) and LDL (-0304 mmol / l (-0479 to -0129) in obese participants only. These associations persisted after Allowing for gestational age in a smaller sample. This finding was consistent in separate analyzes in the Brazilian and Chilean samples. No associations Were found in relation to high-density lipoprotein and triglyceride Concentrations. Conclusion The results Suggest That Those WHO Were of low birth weight and are obese are more likely to Have high cholesterol and LDL Concentrations.

There are few data on Latin American and even fewer on Chilean Patients With psoriasis. Objectives: To ASSESS That Clinical Characteristics and quality of life (QoL) of a group of Chilean Patients With psoriasis. Methods: A cross-sectional, observational and analytic study was Conducted at the Dermatology Department of the Clinical Hospital of the University of Chile Between July 2006 and December 2008 Applying an epidemiological survey and QoL-related to psoriatic patients. Results: One hundred fifty-three Patients With Psoriasis Were included in the study. The mean (SD) age was 42.7 (14.9) years and 60.1% of the Patients Were male. The most frequent disease was plaque psoriasis subtype (71.9%), followed by \guttatiform\"" (guttate streptococcal infection confirmed without morphology) psoriasis (17.7%). In 38.6% of Patients, less than 10% of body surface area (BSA) was AFFECTED. Joint Involvement was reported almost in 28.8% of patients. Those With Early Onset of disease (before 30 years of age) Were more likely to have a positive family history of psoriasis. Hypertension and diabetes Were present in 20.3% and 11.1% of Patients, respectively. The mean Dermatology Life Quality Index was 14. Greater impact of the disease on QoL male sex was associated With, young age of onset, newly diagnosed disease, facial involvement, and Widespread disease.

The aim of esta study was to compare the growth of indigenous and non-indigenous girls During the 36 months after menarche in Chile's Araucanía Region. Methods: A cohort study was concurrent to compare growth Conducted in the two ethnic groups, Which Were Comprised of 114 indigenous and 126 non-indigenous girls who recently experienced menarche and Were Randomly Selected. Height at menarche and was Measured at 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months post-menarche. General linear models used to analyze Were growth and a generalized estimating equation model was used to compare height at 36 months post-menarche. Results: At menarche, the Z-score of height / age was less than for non-indigenous indigenous girls (-0.01 vs. -0.61, p <0.001). Indigenous girls grew at a slower rate than non-indigenous girls (6.5 vs. 7.2 cm, p = 0.02), and height at 36-months post-menarche Reached -0.82 vs. -0.35 cm (p <0.001). In an adjusted model at 36 months post-menarche, indigenous girls Were 1.6 cm shorter than non-indigenous girls (95% confidence interval: -3.13 to -0.04). Conclusions: The height of indigenous girls at menarche was lower than That of non-indigenous girls and They subsequently grew less, Maintaining the Gap Between the two groups. At the end of the follow-up period, the indigenous girls Were Their shorter than non-indigenous peers. © 2015 Friend et al.;BMC PUBLIC HEALTH;2015;Artículo;Biomedical social sciences;0;indigen;girl;menarch;non;height;;0;0;0;12;3;16;3;25;22

The aim of study was to analyze esta Relationship Between the genetic ancestry and Sociodemographic Characteristics and clinical features in a large cohort of American Indian-European SLE patients. Methods A total number of 2,116 SLE Patients of American Indian-European origin and 4,001 SLE Patients of European descent For Whom Were We had clinical data included in the study. Genotyping of 253 continental ancestry-informative markers was performed on the Illumina platform. Were Structure and Admixture software used to determine genetic ancestry proportions of each individually. Logistic regression was used to test the genetic ancestry and Association Between Sociodemographic and Clinical Characteristics. Odds ratios (ORs) Were Calculated With 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Results The average American Indian genetic ancestry of 2,116 was 40.7% SLE Patients. American Indian genetic ancestry Risks of renal conferred Increased Involvement (P <0.0001, OR 3.50 [95% CI 2.63- 4.63]) and early age at onset (P <0.0001). American Indian ancestry protected against photosensitivity (P <0.0001, OR 0.58 [95% CI 0.44 to 0.76]), oral ulcers (P <0.0001, OR 0.55 [95% CI 0.42 to 0.72]), and serositis (P <0.0001, OR 0.56 [95% CI 0.41 to .75]) after adjustment for age, sex, and age at onset. However, age and sex HAD stronger effects than genetic ancestry on malar rash, discoid rash, arthritis, and neurologic Involvement.

1186;2873;Chilean midwives and midwifery students' views of women's midlife health-care needs;Objective: to determine Chilean Midwives' views With regard to Chilean women's health-care needs in midlife. The aim was to explore Chilean Also Midwifery students' views on the clinical care provided to women in midlife. Design: a qualitative study using focus group discussions and narratives Which Were analysed using thematic content analysis manifest and latent. Setting 10 different primary health care (PHC) centers in Santiago, Chile. Participants: 22 midwives, working in PHC clinics and 13 (n = 13) Midwifery Students with PHC clinical experience, attending Their fourth or fifth year of midwifery education at the School of Midwifery in Santiago. Findings: That the midwives felt women in midlife Have special health-care service needs. They Also Considered Themselves to be the MOST Appropriate health staff to care for women Provide health in midlife, but Recognized They Lacked That competence in psychological and social attending health-care needs of women in midlife: such as violence, abuse and sexuality issues.

1187;3033;Impact of education, income and chronic disease risk factors on mortality of adults: does 'a pauper-rich paradox' exist in Latin American societies?;Objectives: To test the hypothesis That exists an inverse association Between socio-economic position and all-cause mortality in a developing country in Latin America. Study design: Prospective Cohort Study Carried out in Chile using data from simple random sample of 920 apparently healthy subjects (aged 30-89 weighted population 11,600 years) followed for 8 years. Methods: Education level (0-8 years, 9-12 years and =13 years) and income quartiles provenance was established at the outset of the study, Along With Behavioral and biological risk factors for chronic diseases: smoking alcohol use, obesity, diabetes , hypertension, lipids and family history of cardiovascular death by disease. Relative Risks of all-cause mortality Were Estimated using age-adjusted Cox regression models. Results: During the follow-up period, 46 deaths Were Observed. Adjusting for age, gender, and behavioral and biological risk factors, the mortality risk for Increasing categories of education after controlling for income was 1.0, 0.76 and 0.33 (P for trend. <. 0.01). In contrast, the relative risk for Increasing levels of income after controlling for education was 1.0, 0.98, 1.33 and 1.17 (P for trend = 0.07). Conclusion: While education level had a protective effect on mortality risk of Chilean adults, had a slightly unfavorable income effect on survival. This finding is suggestive of Described as a 'pauper-rich paradox', since the higher income quantiles In This study Correspond With the lower income levels in MOST Developed Countries.

Knox and Mantel tests used to detect Were space-time interaction Between cases. An ecological Bayesian model adjusted by socioeconomic factor and year was to estimate the incidence Proposed by communes. Initially, there was no space-time interaction Between cases, but there is evidence of clustering effect in urban areas of the region. The incidence rate for the overall study period was 6.18 Estimated by / 100,000 (95% CI: 5.69-6.70), with a significant annual trend of 8.2% (P <0.01). The geographical incidence Could Be Explained by the human development index, as a socioeconomic factor.

Methods and results We cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes subjected, as well as live mice, to nutritional stress and cell death and autophagic Assessed rates. Nutritional stress induced by serum / glucose deprivation induced autophagy strongly and cell death, and inhibited by Were responses Both IGF-1. The Akt / mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway mediated the effects of IGF-1 upon autophagy. Importantly, intracellular ATP starvation Present Decreased levels and oxygen consumption leading to AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation Increased IGF-1 mitochondrial Ca2 + uptake and mitochondrial respiration in nutrient-starved cells. IGF-1 levels Present rescued ATP, reduced AMPK phosphorylation and p70 S6K phosphorylation Increased, Which Indicates That in Addition to Akt / mTOR, IGF-1 Inhibits autophagy by the AMPK / mTOR axis. In mice harboring a liver-specific IGF1 deletion, Which Dramatically you reduce IGF-1 levels plasma, AMPK activity and autophagy Were Increased, and significant heart weight loss was Observed in comparison With wild-type starved animals, revealing The Importance of IGF-1 in Maintaining cardiac adaptability to nutritional insults in vivo. Conclusion Our data support the cardioprotective actions of IGF-1, Which, by rescuing the mitochondrial metabolism and the energetic state of cells, you reduce cell death and controls the Potentially harmful autophagic response to nutritional challenges. IGF-1, Therefore, prove beneficial to mitigate May damage induced by excessive nutrient-related stress, ischemic disease Including in multiple tissues. © 2011 The Author.;CARDIOVASCULAR RESEARCH;2012;Artículo;Cardiac & cardiovascular systems;0;igf;autophagi;nutrit;ampk;stress;;0;0;0;5;5;5;9;11;10
1142;384;Histone Deacetylase Inhibition Blunts Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury by Inducing Cardiomyocyte Autophagy;BACKGROUND -: Reperfusion accounts for a substantial fraction of the myocardial injury occurring With ischemic heart disease. Yet, no standard therapies are available reperfusion injury targeting. Here, we tested the hypothesis hydroxamic acid suberoylanilide That (SAHA), a Histone Deacetylase inhibitor for cancer treatment approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, will blunt reperfusion injury. METHODS AND RESULTS -: Twenty-one Were rabbits randomly Assigned to 3 groups: (1) vehicle control (2) SAHA pretreatment (1 day before surgery and at), and (3) SAHA treatment at the time of reperfusion only. Each arm was subjected to ischemia / reperfusion surgery (30 minutes coronary ligation, 24 hours reperfusion). In Addition, neonatal and adult rat ventricular cultured cardiomyocytes Were subjected to simulated ischemia / reperfusion injury to probe mechanism. SAHA reduced infarct size and systolic function partially rescued When administered before surgery Either (pretreatment) Solely or at the time of reperfusion. SAHA similar to plasma Concentrations Were Those Patients with Cancer in Achieved. In the infarct border zone, SAHA Increased autophagic flux, Assayed in rabbit myocardium and in Both mice harboring an RFP-GFP-LC3 transgene. In cultured myocytes subjected to simulated ischemia / reperfusion injury, cell death SAHA pretreatment reduced by 40%. This reduction in cell death correlated autophagic With Increased activity in SAHA-treated cells. RNAi-mediated knockdown of ATG7 and ATG5, essential autophagy proteins, SAHA's cardioprotective effects abolished. CONCLUSIONS -: The US Food and Drug Administration-approved histone deacetylase inhibitor anticancer, SAHA, you reduce myocardial infarct size in a large animal model, Even When delivered in the context of Clinically Relevant reperfusion. The cardioprotective effects of SAHA During ischemia / reperfusion Occur, at Least in part, through the induction of autophagic flux. © 2 American Heart Association, Inc.;CIRCULATION;2014;Artículo;Cardiac & cardiovascular systems;0;reperfus;saha;injuri;ischemia;autophag;;0;0;0;13;5;13;9;17;10
1143;425;Plasma Exosomes Protect the Myocardium From Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury;Background Exosomes are nanometer-sized vesicles released from cells into the blood, Where They can transmit signals Throughout the body. Shown to act on the heart, exosomes' composition and the signaling pathways They Have not Been Explored activate. We hypothesized That endogenous plasma exosomes can communicate signals to the heart and Provide protection against ischemia and reperfusion injury. Objectives This study to isolate and characterize Sought exosomes from rats and healthy volunteers, evaluate- Their cardioprotective actions, and Identify the Molecular Mechanisms involved. Methods The exosome-rich fraction was isolated from the blood of adult rats and human volunteers and was Analyzed by marker protein expression, transmission electron microscopy, and nanoparticle tracking analysis. This was used in ex vivo Then, in vivo, and in vitro settings of ischemia-reperfusion, with the protective signaling pathways activated on cardiomyocytes using Western blot analyzes Identified and chemical inhibitors. Results Exosomes injury exhibited the expected size and marker proteins CD63 Expressed, CD81, and heat shock protein (HSP) 70. The exosome-rich fraction was powerfully cardioprotective in all tested models of cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury. We Identified pro-survival signaling pathway activated in cardiomyocytes Involving toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 and various kinases, leading to activation of the cardioprotective HSP27. Cardioprotection was preventer by a neutralizing antibody against a conserved epitope HSP70 exosome Expressed on the surface and by blocking TLR4 in cardiomyocytes, Identifying the HSP70 / TLR4 axis communication as a critical component in exosome-mediated cardioprotection. Conclusions Exosomes deliver signals to the endogenous protective myocardium by a pathway TLR4 and classic cardioprotective Involving HSPs. © 2015 American College of Cardiology Foundation.;JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY;2015;Artículo;Cardiac & cardiovascular systems;0;exosom;cardioprotect;signal;hsp;identifi;;0;0;0;5;5;5;8;11;10
1144;524;The effectiveness of antioxidant vitamins C and E in reducing myocardial infarct size in patients subjected to percutaneous coronary angioplasty (PREVEC Trial): study protocol for a pilot randomized double-blind controlled trial;Background: Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Oxidative stress Has Been Involved in the ischemia-reperfusion injury in AMI. It Has Been Suggested That accounts for reperfusion up to 50% of the size of a end myocardial infarct, a part of the damage likely to be prevented.Therefore, we propose That antioxidant vitamins C and reinforcement through E supplementation protect against the ischemia- Should reperfusion damage, infarct size.The just thus decreasing Prevec Trial (Prevention of reperfusion damage associated With percutaneous coronary angioplasty following acute myocardial infarction) seeks to evaluate- antioxidant vitamins C and Whether E reduces infarct size in Patients subjected to percutaneous coronary angioplasty after AMI.Methods / Design: This is a randomized, 1: 1, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study trial.The Takes place at two centers in Chile: University of Chile Clinical Hospital and San Borja Arriarán Clinical hospital.The subjects will be 134 Adults with with acute myocardial infarction indication for percutaneous coronary intervention angioplasty.This is being performed as a pilot stu dy, high-dose vitamin Involving C plus infusion oral administration of vitamin E (Vitamin-treatment group) or placebo (control group) the angioplasty procedure During. Afterward, the Vitamin-treatment group oral doses of vitamins C Receives and E, and the control group placebo for 84 days Receives after coronary infarct size is angioplasty.Primary outcome, Assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), Measured 6 and 84 days after angioplasty.Secondary coronary outcomes are ejection fraction, 6 and 84 Measured days after coronary angioplasty With CMR, and biomarkers for oxidative stress, antioxidant status, heart damage, and inflammation, Which Will Be Measured at baseline, at the onset of reperfusion, 6 to 8 hours after revascularization, and at hospital discharge.Discussion: The ischemia-reperfusion event is occurring During angioplasty myocardial infarct Known to Increase size. The cardioprotective benefits of high doses of vitamin C combined with Vitamin E Have not Been Fully Explored.

1145;550;Angiotensin-(1-9) regulates cardiac hypertrophy in vivo and in vitro;Background: Angiotensin- (1-9) is present in human and rat plasma and Its Increased circulating levels early after myocardial infarction or in animals Treated With inhibitor angiotensin-converting enzyme. However, the cardiovascular effects of esta peptide are unknown. Objective: To determine Whether angiotensin- (1-9) is a novel anti-cardiac hypertrophy factor in vitro and in vivo and is Involved Whether esta peptide in the pharmacological effects of cardiovascular drugs acting on the renin-angiotensin system. Methods and Results: The administration of angiotensin- (1-9) to myocardial infarcted rats by osmotic minipumps (450 ng / kg per min, n = 6) vs. vehicle (n = 8) for 2 weeks Decreased plasma angiotensin II levels, inhibited angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and cardiac myocyte hypertrophy Present preventer. However, cardiac myocyte hypertrophy triggered by angiotensin- attenuation (1-9) was not modified With the simultaneous administration of the angiotensin- (1-7) receptor antagonist A779 (100 ng / kg per min, n = 6). In experiments in vitro cardiac myocytes incubated cultured With With norepinephrine (10 .mu.mol / l) With or insulin-like growth factor-1 (10 nmol / l), angiotensin- (1-9) Also preventer hypertrophy. In other experimental setting, myocardial rats infarcted (n = 37) Were randomized to receive Either vehicle (n = 12), enalapril (10 mg / kg per day, n = 12) or angiotensin II receptor blocker candesartan (10 mg / kg per day, n = 13) for 8 weeks. Both drugs left ventricle hypertrophy preventer and Increased plasma angiotensin- (1-9) levels by Several folds. Angiotensin- (1-9) levels correlated negatively left ventricular hypertrophy With Different markers even after adjustment for blood pressure reduction.

1146;582;Alteration in mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake disrupts insulin signaling in hypertrophic cardiomyocytes;Background: Cardiac hypertrophy is Characterized by Alterations in cardiac bioenergetics Both sensitivity and insulin. Insulin Promotes glucose uptake by cardiomyocytes and Its use as a substrate for glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidation in order to Maintain the high cardiac Energy Demands. Insulin Stimulates Ca2 + release from the endoplasmic reticulum, however, how esta translates to changes in mitochondrial metabolism in hypertrophic cardiomyocytes Either healthy or is not fully Understood. Results: In the present study we Investigated insulin-dependent mitochondrial Ca2 + signaling in Normal and norepinephrine or insulin like growth factor-1-induced hypertrophic cardiomyocytes. Using mitochondrion-selective Ca2 + -fluorescent probes We showed That Increases insulin mitochondrial Ca2 + levels. This signal was inhibited by the pharmacological blockade of inositol 1,4,5-Either the triphosphate receptor or the mitochondrial Ca2 + uniporter, as well as by siRNA-dependent mitochondrial Ca2 + uniporter knockdown. Norepinephrine-stimulated cardiomyocytes Showed a significant decrease in endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondrial contacts Control Compared To Either or insulin like growth factor-1-stimulated cells. This Resulted in a reduction in mitochondrial Ca2 + uptake, Akt activation, glucose uptake and oxygen consumption in response to insulin. cardiomyocyte mitochondrial Ca2 + uptake blocking was sufficient to mimic the effect of norepinephrine-induced hypertrophy on insulin signaling.

1147;653;Microvascular Coronary Flow Comparison in Acute Myocardial Infarction Angioplasty treated with a mesh covered stent (MGUARD Stent) versus Bare Metal Stent. MICAMI-MGUARD.;Background: Distal embolization of thrombus / platelet aggregates myocardial reperfusion Decreases percutaneous coronary intervention During primary (PCI), and is associated With worse long-term immediate and prognosis of Patients With ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Objective: Assess the efficacy of a mesh covered stent (MGuard  stent, MGS) in distal embolization and microvascular preventative reperfusion impairment During primary PCI, Compared with a bare metal stent (BMS). Methods: Forty Patients With STEMI Referred for primary PCI Were randomized for stenting the culprit lesion With the MGS (n = 20) or BMS (n = 20). Blinded experts performed off-line measurements of epicardial and microvascular reperfusion angiographic criteria: TIMI flow grade, myocardial blush, corrected TIMI frame count (CTFC). Results: At baseline clinical, angiographic and procedural variables Between Were not different groups. Post PCI TIMI flow grade was like in Both groups. We Observed better myocardial blush grade in group MGS Compared to BMS (median value 3.0 vs 2.5, 2p = 0.006) and cTFC (mean cTFC MGS 19.65 ± 4.07 vs BMS 27.35 ± 7.15, 2p <0.001, cTFC mean difference MGS-BMS: 7.7, 95% CI: 3.94 to 11.46). MGS stent group had a higher percentage of successful angioplasty (cTFC = 23: MGS 85% vs 30% BMS, 2p <0.001). We had two cases of acute stent thrombosis (one for each group) at 30 days follow up, but no clinical events at 6 months follow up. Conclusions: In this exploratory study, MGS Significantly improved microvascular reperfusion Compared with a BMS criteria in primary PCI.

1148;721;Redistribution of heart failure as the cause of death: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study;Background: Heart failure is sometimes incorrectly listed as the underlying cause of death (UCD) on death certificates, THUS compromising the accuracy and comparability of mortality statistics. Statistical redistribution of the UCD has-been used to examine the effect of misclassification of the UCD Attributed to heart failure, but sex- and race-specific redistribution of deaths on coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality in the United States has not Been examined.Methods : We used coarsened exact matching to infer the UCD of vital records with heart failure as the UCD from 1999 to 2 for decedents 55 years old and older from states encompassing regions under surveillance by the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study (Maryland, Minnesota , Mississippi, and North Carolina). Records with heart failure as the UCD Were matched on decedent Characteristics (five-year age groups, sex, race, education, year of death, and state) to records with heart failure Among the multiple causes listed of death. Each death was heart failure then a plausible redistributed to UCDs proportional to the frequency matched Among records.Results: After redistribution the proportion of deaths Increased for CHD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, hypertensive heart disease, and cardiomyopathy, P <0.001. The percent increase in CHD mortality was the highest after redistribution in Mississippi (12%) and lowest in Maryland (1.6%), with variations by year, race, and sex. Redistribution proportions for CHD CHD death Were similar to classification by a panel of expert Reviewers in the ARIC study.Conclusions: Redistribution of ill-defined UCD would improve increase the accuracy and comparability of mortality statistics used to allocate resources and monitor public health trends mortality. © 2014 Snyder et al . licensee BioMed Central Ltd.;POPULATION HEALTH METRICS;2014;Artículo;Cardiac & cardiovascular systems;0;death;heart;ucd;redistribut;failur;;0;0;0;13;8;9;4;30;6
1149;787;Intracoronary infusion of a combination of bone marrow-derived stem cells in dogs;BACKGROUND: Infusion of diverse types of bone marrow cells, as a source of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) into the ischemic myocardium is emerging as a promising therapy for coronary ischemia, probably mediated by the formation of new blood vessels. Studies Have Shown That while the procedure is safe and feasible, efficacy results are contentious. The Investigators in the present preclinical study hypothesized translation That the infusion of a combination cell product Consisting of EPCs and other cell types, Such as mesenchymal stem cells, the formation of more Promotes stable and mature blood vessels in improved clinical outcomes RESULTING. The safety and feasibility of the intracoronary infusion of cell Such a combination was Assessed in a canine model. METHODS: A mixture of canine autologous mononuclear cells (as the source of EPCs) and ex vivo-expanded mesenchymal bone marrow-derived stem cells or placebo solution infused into intracoronarily Were healthy dogs. Follow-up after cell / placebo infusion included an electrocardiogram, serum cardiac enzyme testing, transthoracic echocardiography at heart and a histopathological examination. RESULTS: On follow-up at all time points after infusion, no significant changes or abnormalities in vital signs, electrocardiogram, transthoracic echocardiography and heart histology Were detected. CONCLUSIONS: From a clinical perspective, the safety and feasibility of the protocol used in the present study animals Demonstrated clinical relevance and provided direct evidence supporting the intracoronary infusion of combination stem / progenitor cell products. © 2 Pulsus Group Inc.

1150;892;Increased levels of oxidative stress, subclinical inflammation, and myocardial fibrosis markers in primary aldosteronism patients;Background: Patients With primary aldosteronism left ventricular hypertrophy greater experience and a higher frequency of cardiovascular events than do essential hypertensive Patients With comparable blood pressure levels. Aldosterone has-been Correlated With Increased oxidative stress, endothelial inflammation, and fibrosis, Particularly in Patients with heart disease. AIM: To evaluate- oxidative stress, endothelial subclinical inflammation, and myocardial fibrosis markers in Patients With primary aldosteronism and essential hypertension. Design and Individuals: We Studied primary aldosteronism 30 Patients and Control 70 essential hypertensive Patients, matched by age, sex and mediate blood pressure. For all Patients, we Measured the serum levels of aldosterone, plasma renin activity, malondialdehyde (MDA), xanthine oxidase, metalloproteinase-9, ultrasensitive C-reactive protein and amino terminal propeptides of type I (PINP), and type III procollagen. We Also EVALUATED the effect of treatment in 19 PA PA Individuals. Results: Patients Showed PA elevated levels of MDA (1.70 ± 0.53 versus 0.94 ± 0.65 mmol / l, P <0.001) and PINP (81.7 ± 50.6 versus 49.7 ± 27 mg / l, P = 0.002) Compared With essential hypertensive controls. We found a positive correlation MDA between, PINP, and the serum aldosterone / plasma renin activity ratio in primary aldosteronism patients.

WE HAVE EVALUATED if the biomarkers of systemic inflammation and endothelial damage, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and soluble thrombomodulin May help in Identifying Patients prone to development of post-operative atrial fibrillation. Methods: One hundred and forty-four Patients in sinus rhythm submitted to elective coronary artery bypass surgery. Systemic inflammatory, oxidative stress and endothelial damage markers Were Measured at baseline and 72 h after surgery. During the procedure, a sample of the right atrial appendage was Obtained for histochemistry. Electrocardiogram was Monitored for 72 h after surgery for adjudication event. Results: 22% of the post-operative Patients developed atrial fibrillation. Baseline systemic inflammatory markers did not differ Between Patients With or Without post-operative atrial fibrillation. However, baseline plasma VCAM-1 and thrombomodulin levels Were Significantly higher in Patients developed post-operative WHO atrial fibrillation. After adjustment for age, gender, comorbidities and concurrent medication, circulating VCAM-1 Remained as an independent predictor for post-operative atrial fibrillation development. No association was Observed Between systemic plasma VCAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression in the tissue right atrial appendage. Conclusions: Patients Undergoing In bypass coronary artery surgery, elevated VCAM-1 levels to predict higher risk for post-operative atrial fibrillation. VCAM-1 plasma elevation is not related to ITS expression in the right atria, suggesting That systemic endothelial damage rather than the local pre-exist in changes Patients WHO Develop the arrhythmia. © 2 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY;2011;Artículo;Cardiac & cardiovascular systems;0;atrial;fibril;oper;post;vcam;;0;0;0;13;6;13;10;17;2

1154;1014;Ventilatory function and cardiovascular disease risk factors: a cross-sectional study in young adults;Background: The Association Between impaired lung function and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors has-been shown in adults. However, there is little evidence of an association in young Such adults, Particularly from South America, Where the burden of CVD and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is as high as in more developed Observed That country clubs. THEREFORE We Investigated the relation Between CVD risk factors Including metabolic syndrome (MS), and lung function status in young adults from Chile. Methods: 970 subjects from a sample of 998 adults born Between 1974 and 1978 in Limache, Chile, Were Studied. A Spanish translation of the European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS) questionnaire was used. Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) Were Measured. Weight, height, waist circumference (WC), blood pressure, Homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR), triglycerides, high density lipoprotein (HDL), glycaemia, and metabolic syndrome (MS) Were Present Assessed. Results: The prevalence of MS was 11.8%. A lower FEV1 and FVC lower Were associated With Having MS (ß-coefficient -0.13 95% Confidence Interval [CI] -0.05 -0.21 to, and ß-coefficient -0.18 95% CI -0.09 -0.27 to, respectively). Both spirometric Measures Were Present negatively associated With Having an elevated HOMA-IR (ß-coefficient for FEV1 -0.08 95% CI -0.03 -0.13 to, and ß-coefficient for FVC -0.11 95% CI -0.05 -0.17 to) .

1155;1108;Markedly increased Rho-kinase activity in circulating leukocytes in patients with chronic heart failure;Background: The small guanosine triphosphatase Rho and Rho-kinase target ITS Have significant roles in experimental ventricular remodeling and dysfunction, but no data are available on Rho-kinase activation in Patients with heart failure (HF). We hypothesized That, in Patients With chronic HF, Rho-kinase is activated in circulating leukocytes and related to left ventricular (LV) remodeling and dysfunction. Methods: accordingly, Rho-kinase activity, Assessed by the levels of phosphorylated to all myosin light chain phosphatase 1 (MYPT1-P / T) in circulating leukocytes, and echocardiographic LV function data Were Compared Between Patients With HF New York Heart Association functional class II or III due to systolic dysfunction (n = 17), healthy controls (n = 17), and hypertensive Patients without HF (n = 17). Results: In the subjects control mean MYPT1-P / T ratio was 1.2 ± 0.2 (it was like in the hypertensive Patients without HF), HF Whereas In Patients With, it was Significantly Increased by> 100-fold (P <0.001 ). Both MYPT1-P / T and log MYPT1-P / T ratios Were inversely correlated With ejection fraction (r = -0.54, P <0.03 and r = -0.86, P <0.001, respectively). Furthermore, in Patients With HF With LV end-diastolic diameter <60 mm, MYPT1-P / T ratio was 35.8 ± 18.1, Whereas it was Significantly higher in Patients With LV diameter =60 mm (P <0.05). Conclusions: Rho-Kinase activity is in Patients With Increased markedly stable chronic HF under optimal medical treatment, and it is associated With Pathologic LV remodeling and systolic dysfunction. Mechanisms of Rho-kinase activation in Patients With HF, ITS role in the progression of the disease, and the direct effect of Rho-kinase inhibition need further investigation. © 2011 Mosby, Inc.

1156;1158;Thrombin-Receptor Antagonist Vorapaxar in Acute Coronary Syndromes;BACKGROUND: vorapaxar is a new protease-activated oral-receptor 1 (PAR-1) antagonist That Inhibits thrombin-induced platelet activation. METHODS: In this multinational, double-blind, randomized trial, we vorapaxar Compared With Placebo in Patients Who Had 12,944 acute coronary syndromes without ST-segment elevation. The primary end point was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, stroke, recurrent ischemia With rehospitalization, or urgent coronary revascularization. RESULTS: Follow-up in the trial was terminated early after a safety review. After a median follow-up of 502 days (interquartile range, 349 to 667), the primary end point occurred in 1031 of 6473 Patients receiving vorapaxar 6471 versus 1102 of Patients receiving placebo (Kaplan-Meier 2-year rate, 18.5% vs. 19.9% hazard ratio, 0.92 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85 to 1.01 P = 0.07). A composite of death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, or stroke occurred in 822 Patients in the vorapaxar group versus 910 in the placebo group (14.7% and 16.4%, respectively hazard ratio, 0.89 95% CI, 0.81 to 0.98 P = 0.02). Rates of moderate and severe bleeding Were 7.2% in the 5.2% vorapaxar group and the placebo group in (hazard ratio, 1.35 95% CI, 1.16 to 1.58 P <0.001).

1157;1258;Modulation of cardiac ryanodine receptor activity by ROS and RNS;Calcium release through ryanodine receptors cardiac (RyR2) triggers heart muscle contraction. Reactive oxygen / nitrogen species (ROS / RNS), normally produced in the heart, Promote RyR2 Snitrosylation and endogenous S-glutathionylation. These reversible redox Modifications Increase RyR2 activity in vitro, and presumably Present in vivo. S-glutathionylation RyR2 Increases under Physiologically Relevant conditions (tachycardia and exercise), suggesting That Utilize cardiac cells esta redox modification to Increase RyR2 activity under Increased demand. In contrast, in vivo changes in RyR2 S-nitrosylation in response to physiological stimuli REMAIN uncharacterized. The number and identity of the highly reactive cysteine <U+200B><U+200B>residues RyR2 and the nature of the redox modification are presently unknown They undergo. Likewise, the physiological sources of ROS / RNS RyR2 responsible for functionally Relevant redox Modifications Have not Been completely identified.

1158;1260;Calpain translocation and activation as pharmacological targets during myocardial ischemia/reperfusion;Contribute to calpains myocardial reperfusion-induced cell death. However, it remains controversial Whether ITS activation OCCURS During ischemia or reperfusion. We Investigated the regulation and time-course of calpain activation secondary to transient ischemia and the efficacy of its Inhibition at reperfusion as a therapeutic strategy to limit infarct size. In isolated rat hearts (Sprague-Dawley), ischemia induced a time-dependent translocation of m-calpain to the membrane was not associated With That calpain activation by proteolysis of as Assessed a-fodrin STI substrate. Translocation of calpain was dependent on Ca2 + entry through reverse mode Na + / Ca2 + -Exchange and was independent of acidosis. Calpain activation occurred During reperfusion, but only after intracellular pH (pHi) normalization, and was not preventer by inhibiting translocation ITS During ischemia-ß-methyl With cyclodextrin.

1159;1345;Effects of chronic intermittent hypoxia and polyunsaturated fatty acids on infarct size and oxidative stress markers in cardiac ischemia reperfusion;Chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) induces structural and functional changes in heart, probably associated ischemia-reperfusion With (IR), to pathophysiological event linked With excessive reactive oxygen species generation. The cardioprotective effects of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) Have not Been Characterized well in CIH. The aim of esta study was to determine the effects of CIH and PUFA on infarct size (IS) and oxidative stress markers in cardiac IR. Twenty-eight adult rats Were randomly divided in 4 groups: normobaric normoxia (Nx) Nx + PUFA (0.3 g.kg-1d-1) hypobaric hypoxia (Hx) and Hx + PUFA. CIH was induced by four periods of hypoxia-normoxia intercalate With 96 hours intervals each, in a hypobaric chamber (428 tor pO2: 89.6 mmHg) During 32 days. In ex vivo model (Langendorff) Were hearts subjected to 30 min of ischemia followed by 120 min of reperfusion. The IS, TBARS, GSH / GSSG ratio and IL-1beta levels Were Assessed in hearts. Decreased size Infart in 25.8% (Nx + PUFA), 38.8% (Hx) and 51.7% (Hx + PUFA), relative to Nx (P & lt 0.05 vs. all Nx). In Addition, TBARS (38.1%) and IL-1beta (23.8%) diminished cardiac levels in Hx rats relative to Nx (P & lt 0.05). Hypoxia and PUFA supplementation are Independently Associated With lower levels of These stress markers and higher levels of GSH / GSSG ratio. These findings Suggest That CIH and PUFA induces cardioprotective effect associated With an enhanced antioxidant and anti-inflammatory status. © 2 et al .

1160;1990;Role of Heterotrimeric G Protein and Calcium in Cardiomyocyte Hypertrophy Induced by IGF-1;In the heart, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is a peptide with Pro-hypertrophic and anti-apoptotic actions. The pro-hypertrophic properties of IGF-1 Have Been Attributed to the extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. Recently, we reported almost That IGF-1 Increases intracellular Ca2 + levels Present through pertussis toxin (PTX) -sensitive G protein. Here we investigate Whether esta Ca2 + signal is Involved in IGF-1-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Our results show That the IGF-1-induced Ca2 + Increase in level is abolished by the IGF-1 receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG538, PTX and the peptide inhibitor of Gß<U+03B3> signaling, ßARKct. Increases in the activities of Ca2 + -dependent enzymes calcineurin, calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII), and protein kinase C.alpha (PKCa) Were Observed at 5 min after IGF-1 exposure. AG538, PTX, ßARKct, and the dominant negative PKCa preventer the IGF-1-dependent phosphorylation of ERK1 / 2. Participation of calcineurin and CaMKII in ERK phosphorylation was discounted. IGF-1-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, cell size and determined to by ß-myosin heavy chain (ß-MHC), was preventer by AG538, PTX, ßARKct, dominant negative PKCa, and the MEK1 / 2 inhibitor PD98059.

1161;2038;Intraprocedural and Long-Term Incomplete Occlusion of the Left Atrial Appendage Following Placement of the WATCHMAN Device: A Single Center Experience;WATCHMAN LAA Incomplete Occlusion by Device. Introduction: Transcatheter left atrial appendage (LAA) closure With the WATCHMAN device has Become One of the therapeutic options in atrial fibrillation (AF) Patients Who are at high risk for ischemic stroke. However, the incidence and evolution of incomplete occlusion of the LAA During and after placement of the WATCHMAN device has not Been Reported. Methods and Results: Fifty-eight consecutive Patients Who Had undergone implant WATCHMAN device included in the study Were. Intraprocedural, 45-day and 12-month transesophageal echocardiogram images Were reviewed and Analyzed. Peridevice gap was NOTED in 16 (27.6%), 17 (29.3%), and 20 (34.5%) Patients across the three time points. Intraprocedural gaps are more likely to be persistent Until 12 months and Become larger in size over time. New Gap Also OCCURS During follow-up even if the LAA was completely sealed at implantation. One patient Had an ischemic stroke 4.7 months after implant another patient developed a left atrial thrombus over the 21.6 months after device implant. Both Patients HAD intraprocedural gap and discontinued warfarin therapy after the 45-day evaluation. Conclusion: Incomplete LAA occlusion with a gap Between the WATCHMAN LAA device and the wall surface is Relatively common. Intraprocedural gaps are more likely to Become bigger over time and persist, while new gaps Also Occur During follow-up. Further studies are warranted to verify the presence and persistence Whether of a peridevice gap is Associated With Increased risk of thromboembolic event in AF Patients implanted with a WATCHMAN device. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.;JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY;2012;Artículo;Cardiac & cardiovascular systems;0;gap;devic;laa;watchman;implant;;0;0;0;12;6;12;7;26;6

1165;2970;Effects of Trimetazidine in Nonischemic Heart Failure: A Randomized Study;Objectives Heart failure (HF) is associated With changes in myocardial metabolism That lead to impairment of contractile function. Trimetazidine (TMZ) modulates cardiac energetic efficiency and Improves outcomes in ischemic heart disease. We EVALUATED the effects of TMZ on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), cardiac metabolism, exercise capacity, O2 uptake, and Quality of Life in Patients With nonischemic HF. Methods and Results Sixty Patients With stable nonischemic HF under optimal medical therapy Were Included in this randomized double-blind study. Patients randomized to Were TMZ (35 mg orally twice a day) or placebo for 6 months. LVEF, 6-minute walk test (6MWT), maximum O2 uptake in cardiopulmonary exercise test, different markers of metabolism, oxidative stress, and endothelial function, and quality of life were Assessed at baseline and after TMZ treatment. Left ventricular peak glucose uptake was EVALUATED With the use of the maximum standardized uptake value (SUV) by 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET 18FDG). Etiology was idiopathic in 85% and 15% in hypertensive. Both groups Were like in age, functional class, LVEF, and levels of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide at baseline. After 6 months of TMZ treatment, no changes Were Observed in LVEF (31 ± 10% vs 34 ± 8% P = 0.8), 6MWT (443 ± 25 vs 506 ± 79 m m P = 0.03), maximum O2 uptake (19.1 ± 5.0 mL kg-1 min-1 vs 23.0 ± 7.2 mL kg-1 min-1, P = 0.11), functional class (Percentages of Patients in functional classes I / II / III / IV 10/3753 / 0 vs 7/40/50/3 P = .14), or quality of life (32 ± 26 vs 24 ± 18 points points P = 0.25) in TMZ versus placebo, respectively. In the subgroup of Patients With EVALUATED 18FDG-PET, no significant Differences Were Observed in SUV Between Both groups (7.0 ± 3.6 vs 8.2 ± 3.4 respectively P = 0.47). Conclusions In Patients With nonischemic HF, the Addition of TMZ to optimal medical treatment does not result in significant changes of LVEF, exercise capacity, O2 uptake, or quality of life. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

1166;2973;A Randomized Controlled Trial to Prevent Post-Operative Atrial Fibrillation by Antioxidant Reinforcement;Objectives This study was designed to assess it Whether the reinforcement of the antioxidant system, through n-3 fatty acids plus antioxidant vitamin supplementation, reduces the incidence of Could post-operative atrial fibrillation. Background Therapy to Prevent post-operative atrial fibrillation remains suboptimal. Oxidative stress plays, Although a key role in the pathogenesis of esta arrhythmia, antioxidant produced controversial results have reinforcement. Methods A total number of 203 Patients scheduled for on-pump cardiac surgery Were randomized to placebo or supplementation With n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (2 g / day) (eicosapentaenoic acid: docosahexaenoic acid ratio 1: 2), vitamin C (1 g / day) and vitamin E (400 IU / day). The primary outcome was the occurrence of post-operative atrial fibrillation. Secondary outcomes Were the biomarkers related to oxidative stress and inflammation. Results Post-operative atrial fibrillation occurred in 10 of 103 Patients (9.7%) in the Supplemented group versus 32 of 100 Patients (32%) in the placebo group (p <0.001). Early after surgery, placebo Patients With Increased levels of presented biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress, Which Were markedly attenuated by antioxidant supplementation. The activity of catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase in atrial tissue of the Supplemented Patients was 24.0%, 17.1%, and 19.7% higher than the respective placebo values <U+200B><U+200B>(p <0.05). The atrial tissue of Patients WHO developed NADPH oxidase atrial fibrillation Showed p47 phox subunit-protein and mRNA expression 38.4% and 35.7% higher, respectively, than in sinus rhythm Patients (p <0.05).

Aging is the major risk factor for esta arrhythmia. Reinforcing the antioxidant defense system would be expected to protect the myocardium against ischaemia-reperfusion damage. We Studied the effect of antioxidant reinforcement and aging on the occurrence of postoperative AF.METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed in Patients scheduled for cardiac surgery extracorporeal circulation With. Supplementation With omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) and vitamins C and E, or placebo was administered to 152 divided by age Patients: Patients young (30-59 years) and old Patients (60-80 years). For the detection of AF, we used 12-Lead EKGs and Holter. Antioxidant enzyme activity was determined to in atrial tissue. Oxidative stress was Assessed through plasma malondialdehyde levels.RESULTS: Supplemented Patients over 60 years old Showed higher glutathione peroxidase activity than in the Control Patients same age range. There was no difference Between the Supplemented and placebo groups in Patients under 60 years old. The decrease in the incidence of postoperative AF in Supplemented Patients was more marked in the older than in the younger Patients ones.CONCLUSIONS: Since the antioxidant supplementation With n-3 PUFAs and vitamins C and E Resulted in a more marked reduction of postoperative AF in Patients older, It could be Suggested That the efficacy of therapy esta Improves With aging. © 2012 The Author 2012.

Several histologic abnormalities, interstitial fibrosis: such as and vacuolization, Have Been Described in atrial samples from Patients developing POAF. This ultrastructural remodeling Has Been Associated With the establishment of a proarrhythmic substrate. We Studied Whether autophagy is activated in atrial WHO Patients Develop POAF. Methods: A total number of 170 Patients in sinus rhythm Who Had undergone elective coronary artery bypass grafting Were included. Systemic inflammatory markers Were Measured at baseline and 72 hours after surgery. During the procedure, samples of the right atrial appendages Were Obtained for evaluation of remodeling by light and electron microscopy. Protein ubiquitination and autophagy-related LC3B Were Assessed processing by Western blot. Results: Of These Patients, 22% developed POAF. The level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, fibrosis, inflammation, myxoid degeneration, and ubiquitin-aggregates in the atria did not differ Between Patients With and without POAF. Electron microphotographs of Those With POAF Showed a significant accumulation of autophagic vesicles and lipofuscin deposits. Total protein ubiquitination was like in the Patients With and without POAF, but was markedly reduced processing LC3B in Those With POAF, suggesting a selective impairment in autophagic flow.

In cardiac myocytes, T-tubules CONFER the compartmentation of Ca Necessary signals, Which Allows sarcomere contraction in response to plasma membrane depolarization, but there is a similarly Whether tunneling structure extracellular Ca stimulation to nuclear control signals have not Been Explored locally. Objective: To study the role of perinuclear Ca sarcolemma in nuclear selective signaling. Methods and Results: We report here That insulin-like growth factor 1 triggers a fast and independent nuclear Ca in neonatal rat cardiac signal myocytes, cardiac myocytes human embryonic, adult rat cardiac myocytes and. This response is fast and localized Achieved by activation of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor signaling complexes present in perinuclear invaginations of the plasma membrane. The perinuclear inositol insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor extracellular pool Connects stimulation to the local activation of nuclear transcriptional upregulation and Ca signaling through the perinuclear hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5 biphosphate 1,4,5-trisphosphate-production, nuclear Ca release, and activation of the transcription factor myocyte-enhancing factor 2C. Genetically engineered buffers Ca-parvalbumin-with nuclear cytosolic or nuclear localization Demonstrated That the Ca handling system is physically and functionally segregated from the cytosolic Ca signaling machinery.

1172;3670;Oxidative Stress and Pathophysiology of Ischemic Stroke: Novel Therapeutic Opportunities;Stroke is the second leading cause of death, after ischemic heart disease, and accounts for 9% of deaths worldwide. ACCORDING to the World Health Organization [WHO], 15 million people worldwide suffer stroke each year. Of these, more than 6 million die and another 5 million are permanently disabled. Reactive oxygen species [ROS] Have Been Implicated in ischemic brain injury after stroke. There is evidence That a rapid Increase in the production of ROS Immediately after acute ischemic stroke overwhelm antioxidant defenses Rapidly, Causing further tissue damage. These ROS can damage cellular macromolecules leading to autophagy, apoptosis, and necrosis. , Moreover, the rapid restoration of blood flow Increases the level of tissue oxygenation and accountsfor a second burst of ROS generation, Which leads to reperfusion injury. Current Measures to protect the brain against damage severe stroke are Insufficient. THUS, it is critical to investigate antioxidant strategies lead to the diminution That of oxidative injury.

1173;3700;Mitochondrial Fission and Autophagy in the Normal and Diseased Heart;Promotes sustained hypertension structural, functional and metabolic remodeling of cardiomyocyte mitochondria. As long-lived, postmitotic cells, cardiomyocytes turn over to Compensate for mitochondria Continuously changes in energy Demands and to remove damaged organelles. This process Involves fusion and fission of mitochondria to generate new Existing organelles and separate old ones for degradation via autophagy. Autophagy is a lysosome-dependent proteolytic pathway capable of processing cellular components, organelles and protein aggregates Including. Autophagy can be selective or nonselective Either and Contributes to remodeling of the myocardium under stress. Fission of mitochondria, loss of membrane potential, and ubiquitination are emerging as critical steps That direct selective autophagic degradation of mitochondria. This review discusses the Molecular Mechanisms controlling mitochondrial dynamics, Including fission, fusion, transport, and degradation. Furthermore, it examine recent studies revealing the Importance of These Processes in Normal and diseased heart. © 2 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.;CURRENT HYPERTENSION REPORTS;2010;Artículo;Cardiac & cardiovascular systems;0;mitochondria;autophagi;degrad;fission;organell;;0;0;0;5;5;5;9;11;12
1174;4054;Mitochondria, Myocardial Remodeling, and Cardiovascular Disease;The process of remodeling muscle lies at the core ofmost cardiovascular diseases. Adaptation to cardiac pressure or volume overload is associated with a molecular complex change in cardiomyocytes Which leads to anatomic remodeling of the heart muscle. Adaptive, Although at its beginnings, the sustained cardiac hypertrophic remodeling almost unavoidably ends in progressive muscle dysfunction, heart failure and death Ultimately. One of the features of cardiac remodeling is a progressive impairment in mitochondrial function. The heart has the highest oxygen uptake in the human body and accordingly it has a large number of mitochondria, Which form a complex network under constant remodeling in order to sustain the high metabolic rate of cardiac cells and serve as Ca2 + buffers acting Together with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However, This high dependence on mitochondrial metabolism Has Its costs: when oxygen supply is Threatened, high leak of electrons from the electron transport chain leads to oxidative stress and mitochondrial failure. These three aspects of mitochondrial function (Reactive oxygen species signaling, mitochondrial Ca2 + handling and dynamics) are critical for the normal muscle homeostasis. In this article, we will review the latest evidence linking mitochondrial morphology and function With the process of myocardial remodeling and cardiovascular disease. © Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2012.;CURRENT HYPERTENSION REPORTS;2012;Artículo;Cardiac & cardiovascular systems;0;mitochondri;remodel;cardiac;muscl;function;function;49;16;0.0108695652173913;5;5;5;9;11;12
1175;4094;Stimulation of NOX2 in isolated hearts reversibly sensitizes RyR2 channels to activation by cytoplasmic calcium;The response of ryanodine receptor (RyR) channels to cytoplasmic free calcium concentration ([Ca2 +]) is redox sensitive. Here, we report the effects of oxidative stress on a mild cardiac RyR (RyR2) in Langendorff perfused rat channels hearts. Single RyR2 channels from the same ventricles Control displayed three responses to Ca2 + Reported in other mammalian tissues, Characterized by low, moderate, or high maximal activation. A single episode of 5 min of Global ischemia, followed by 1 min of reperfusion, enhanced 2.3-fold the activity of NOX2 Compared to controls and changed the frequency distribution of the different responses of RyR2 channels to calcium, Favoring the more active ones: high activity response Increased activity and low Decreased With respect to response controls. This change was fully preventer by perfusion apocynin With VAS 2870 or before ischemia and totally reversed by the extension of the reperfusion period to 15 minutes. In vitro activation of NOX2 in SR Control vesicles mimicked the effect of the ischemia / reperfusion episode on the frequencies of emergence of single RyR2 channel responses to [Ca2 +] and Increased 2.2-fold the rate of calcium release in Ca2 +-loaded SR vesicles. In vitro changes Were reversed at the single channel level by DTT and in isolated SR vesicles by glutaredoxin. Our results Indicate That in whole hearts to mild oxidative stress Enhances the response of cardiac RyR2 calcium channels via NOX2 to activation, probably by S-glutathionylation of RyR2 protein. This change is fully reversible and transitory, suggesting a possible role of redox modification in the physiological response of cardiac RyR2 to Influx cellular calcium. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.;JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR CARDIOLOGY;2014;Artículo;Cardiac & cardiovascular systems;0;ryr;respons;channel;calcium;singl;;0;0;0;5;5;5;9;17;24
1176;4284;Cardiomyocyte ryanodine receptor degradation by chaperone-mediated autophagy;Time for primary review: 15 daysAimsChaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is a selective mechanism for the degradation of soluble cytosolic proteins bearing the sequence KFERQ. These proteins are targeted by chaperones and delivered to lysosomes translocated into Where They are the lysosomal lumen via the lysosome and degraded-associated membrane protein type 2A (LAMP-2A). Mutations in LAMP2 That inhibit autophagy result in Danon disease Characterized by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The ryanodine receptor type 2 (RyR2) plays a key role in cardiomyocyte excitation-contraction and Its dysfunction can lead to cardiac failure. Whether RyR2 is degraded by CMA is unknown.Methods and resultsTo induces CMA, neonatal rat cardiomyocytes cultured Were Treated With geldanamycin (GA) to Promote protein degradation pathway through esta. GA LAMP-2A Increased levels together With its redistribution and colocalization With Hsc70 in the perinuclear region, changes indicative of CMA activation. The inhibition of proteasomes preventer lysosomes but not the loss of RyR2. The recovery of RyR2 content after incubation With GA by siRNA targeting LAMP-2A RyR2 Suggests That is degraded via CMA. In silico analysis revealed Also That the harbors six KFERQ RyR2 sequence motifs Which are required for the recognition Hsc70 and Its degradation via CMA. Our data Suggest That presenilins are Involved in RyR2 degradation by CMA.ConclusionThese findings are consistent with a model in Which oxidative damage of the RyR2 targets it for turnover by presenilins and CMA, Which Could Lead to removal of damaged or leaky RyR2 channels. © 2012 The Author.;CARDIOVASCULAR RESEARCH;2013;Artículo;Cardiac & cardiovascular systems;0;ryr;cma;degrad;lamp;lysosom;;0;0;0;5;5;5;9;11;2
1177;4461;Iron induces protection and necrosis in cultured cardiomyocytes: Role of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide;We investigate here the role of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide in iron-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy or cell death. Cultured rat cardiomyocytes incubated With 20 uM iron (added as FeCl3-Na nitrilotriacetate, Fe-NTA) displayed hypertrophy features That included Increased protein synthesis and cell size, plus realignment of F-actin filaments Along With sarcomeres and activation of the atrial natriuretic factor gene promoter. Incubation With higher Fe-NTA Concentrations (100 uM) produced cardiomyocyte death by necrosis. Incubation for 24 h With Fe-NTA (20-40 uM) or the nitric oxide donor <U+0394>-NONOate Increased iNOS iNOS mRNA but Decreased protein levels These conditions under, iron stimulated the activity and the dimerization of iNOS. Fe-NTA (20 uM) Promoted short- and long-term generation of reactive oxygen species, Whereas preincubation with L-arginine esta suppressed response. Preincubation With 20 PM Fe-NTA Also the necrotic cell death attenuated triggered by 100 uM Fe-NTA, suggesting That Have These preincubation conditions cardioprotective effects. Inhibition of iNOS activity 1400 W With enhanced iron-induced ROS generation and preventer Both iron-dependent cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and cardioprotection. In conclusion, we propose That Fe-NTA (20 uM) Stimulates iNOS activity and the enhanced NO production That, by hypertrophy and Enhancing survival Promoting Mechanisms through ROS reduction, is beneficial to cardiomyocytes. At higher Concentrations, however, iron triggers cardiomyocyte death by necrosis. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

1088;64;Inverse Susceptibility to Oxidative Death of Lymphocytes Obtained From Alzheimer's Patients and Skin Cancer Survivors: Increased Apoptosis in Alzheimer's and Reduced Necrosis in Cancer;A paucity of cancer in Individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and low rates of AD in cancer survivors Has Been Reported in epidemiological studies. Deregulation in opposite directions of Biological Mechanisms, Such as susceptibility to cell death, might be shared in the two disorders. We Analyzed lymphocytes from AD and skin cancer Patients as well as healthy controls and found Significantly Increased vulnerability of AD lymphocytes to H2O2-induced apoptotic death and higher resistance to death of skin lymphocytes cancer, due to reduced necrosis, as Compared With healthy controls by pairwise adjusted for age comparisons and sex. H2O2-induced death in lymphocytes was reduced caspase independent and Significantly by PARP-1 inhibition in all three groups. These Differences in the susceptibility to cell death Observed for lymphocytes from AD and Skin Cancer Patients May Be One of the Mechanisms That Help Explain the inverse correlation Between These diseases detected in epidemiological studies. © The Author 2012.

1090;260;A Clinical Perspective: Anti Tau's Treatment in Alzheimer's Disease;Alzheimer's Disease (AD) physiopathology is not yet totally established. NEVERTHELESS it is Known That a metabolism dysfunction of the beta amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the abnormal tau protein phosphorylation lead to the formation of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, respectively. These events finally drive to the clinical expression of dementia. Formally Approved During The past decade, treatments for AD are lacking of an updating, being Essentially symptomatic. Have anticholinesterase agents failed in providing a substantial improvement in the mental health condition of AD patients. On the other hand, antiamyloid strategies, have failed in Their efficacy or security on Their last development phases. In This context, tau Represents a potential therapeutic target, by the action of drugs That diminish aggregation ITS, or ITS acting by altering phosphorylation or filaments formation. There is anti-tau Also Such strategies as usual miscellaneous microtubule-stabilizing agents.

1091;261;Fulvic Acid Inhibits Aggregation and Promotes Disassembly of Tau Fibrils Associated with Alzheimer's Disease;Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder Involving extracellular plaques (amyloid-ß) and intracellular tangles of tau protein. Recently, Tangle formation has been identified as a major event in the neurodegenerative process Involved, due to the conversion of soluble peptides or oligomers Either into insoluble filaments. At present, the current therapeutic strategies are Aimed at Natural phytocomplexes and polyphenolics compounds able to inhibit the formation of Either tau filaments or disaggregate them. However, only a few polyphenolic molecules Have Emerged to Prevent tau aggregation, and Natural drugs targeting tau Have not Been approved yet. Fulvic acid, humic substance to, you Several nutraceutical properties with potential activity to protect cognitive impairment. In This work We provide evidence to show That the process of tau protein aggregation, forming paired helical filaments (PHF) in vitro, fulvic acid is inhibited by the length of fibrils Affecting and Their morphology. In Addition, we Investigated Whether fulvic acid is capable of disassembling preformed PHFs. We show That the fulvic acid is an active compound against preformed fibrils Affecting the whole structure by diminishing length of PHF and probably acting at the hydrophobic level, as we Observed by atomic force techniques. THUS, fulvic acid is likely to Provide new insights in the development of potential treatments for Alzheimer's disease using natural products. © 2011-IOS Press and the authors.

1093;267;Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Pathogenesis: A Journey Through the Secretory Pathway;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the MOST common adult-onset motoneuron disease Characterized by the degenerative loss of motoneurons selective in the ventral horn spinal, brainstem nuclei MOST, and the cerebral cortex. , Although approximately 90% of ALS cases are sporadic (SALs), analyzes of familial ALS (FALS) -causative genes Have insight into molecular Relevant generated events Involved in the pathology. Here we overview an emerging concept indicating the occurrence of stress secretory pathway in the disease process. These Alterations include a failure in the protein folding machinery at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), engagement of the unfolded protein response (UPR) Modifications of the Golgi apparatus network, vesicular impaired trafficking, inhibition of protein quality Mechanisms control oxidative damage to ER proteins, and sustained activation of degradative pathways Such as autophagy. A common feature Predicted for MOST of These is abnormal protein homeostasis Alterations Associated With the accumulation of misfolded proteins at the ER, possibly leading to chronic ER stress and neuronal dysfunction. Signs of ER stress are presymptomatic stages Observed During even in FALS mouse models, and pharmacological strategies to alleviate protein misfolding disease progression slow. Because the secretory pathway in stress OCCURS sALS Both forms of Fals and Several, May it offer a unique common target for possible therapeutic strategies to treat devastating disease esta. © 2 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.;ANTIOXIDANTS & REDOX SIGNALING;2010;Artículo;Clinical neurology;0;protein;stress;common;fal;pathway;protein;107;5;0.0237355811889973;5;5;5;8;11;2
1094;350;Prognosis of Cryptogenic Ischemic Stroke: A Prospective Single-Center Study in Chile;Approximately 25% -40% of ischemic strokes are of unknown cause Considered (ie, cryptogenic). The available information on associated risk factors, functional outcome, and recurrence of esta subtype of stroke is limited, especially for the Chilean population. We Conducted a prospective cohort study of 380 Patients aged =18 years ADMITTED consecutively to a stroke unit with ischemic stroke Demonstrated. The stroke subtypes Were classified ACCORDING TO The Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment criteria. The modified Rankin Scale score and Barthel Index Were used to ASSESS functional outcome. The Kaplan-Meier product-limit method and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis Were used to Identify predictors of recurrent stroke During the follow-up period (mean, 2.1 years). Cryptogenic stroke (CS) was diagnosed in 76 Patients (20%), 55.2% of them male, with a mean age of 62 ± 17 years. CS was the third MOST common stroke subtype after the large-artery disease (29%) and cardioembolic (24.4%) subtypes. After adjustment for age and sex, no vascular risk factors or laboratory parameters Assessed at the time of admission Were found to be predictive of CS. The CS subtype Had the lowest rate of stroke recurrence at the end of the follow-up period (n = 4 2.5% per year odds ratio, 0.32 95% confidence interval, 0.11 to 0.91 P = .022), to pro functional outcome (Rankin Scale score modified mean, 2, mean Barthel Index, 77), and not Increase in mortality risk (odds ratio, 0.73 95% confidence interval, 0.29-1.77 P = 0.48). Our findings Demonstrate That Patients With No Definite etiology after an extensive workup Identified are at lower risk of recurrence and more likely to have a positive outcome.

1096;404;Clinical Prediction Algorithm (BRAIN) to Determine Risk of Hematoma Growth in Acute Intracerebral Hemorrhage;BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE -: We developed and validated a single algorithm to predict the risk of acute intracerebral hematoma growth in spontaneous hemorrhage (ICH) to better inform clinicians and Researchers in Their Efforts to Improve outcomes for patients. METHODS -: We Analyzed data from the computed tomography substudies of the pilot and main phases of the Intensive Blood Pressure Reduction in Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage Trials (INTERACT1 and 2, respectively). The study group was divided into a derivation cohort (INTERACT2, n = 964) and a validation cohort (INTERACT1, n = 346). Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify identity clinically significant factors associated With (=6 mL) Increase in volume at 24 hours after symptom onset hematoma. A parsimonious risk score was developed on the basis of regression coefficients derived from the logistic model. RESULTS -: A 24-point score was derived from BRAIN INTERACT2 (C-statistic, 0.73) based on baseline ICH volume (mL per score, =10 = 0, 10-20 = 5,> 20 = 7), recurrent ICH ( yes = 4), warfarin anticoagulation With symptom onset at (yes = 6), intraventricular extension (yes = 2), and number of hours to baseline computed tomography from symptom onset (=1 = 5, 2/1 = 4, 2- 3 = 3, 3-4 = 2, 4-5 = 1> 5 = 0) Predicted the probability of ICH growth (ranging from 3.4% for 0 point to 85.8% for 24 points) with good discrimination (C-statistic, 0.73) and calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow P = 0.82) in INTERACT1. CONCLUSIONS -: The Simple BRAIN score predicts the probability of hematoma growth in ICH. This Could be Used to Improve risk stratification for research and clinical practice.

1097;409;Hemostatic Therapy in Experimental Intracerebral Hemorrhage Associated With the Direct Thrombin Inhibitor Dabigatran;Background and Purpose: Dabigatran etexilate-(DE) has-been recently approved for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. However, lack of effective antagonists Represents a major concern in the event of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The Aims of the present study Were to Establish a murine model of ICH Associated With dabigatran, and to test the efficacy of different hemostatic factors in preventative hematoma growth. Methods: In C57BL / 6 mice receiving OF (4.5 or 9.0 mg / kg), in vivo and in vitro coagulation assays and dabigatran plasma levels Were Measured Repeatedly. Thirty minutes after inducing ICH by striatal collagenase injection, mice received an intravenous injection of saline, prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC 100 U / kg), murine fresh-frozen plasma (200 .mu.L), or recombinant human factor VIIa (8.0 mg / kg ). Quantified ICH volume on brain cryosections was 24 hours later. Results: DE Substantially tail vein prolonged bleeding time and clotting time ecarin for 4 hours Corresponding to dabigatran plasma levels. Intracerebral hematoma expansion was mainly Observed During the first 3 hours on T2 * MRI serial. Anticoagulation With high doses of the volume of hematoma Increased Significantly. PCC and, less consistently, fresh-frozen plasma excess preventer hematoma expansion Caused by DE, factor VIIa recombinant human Whereas was ineffective. Prevention of hematoma growth and reversal of tail vein bleeding time by PCC Were dose-dependent. Conclusions: The study Provides strong evidence That PCC and, less consistently, fresh-frozen intracerebral hematoma Prevent excess plasma expansion in a murine model ICH Associated With dabigatran. The efficacy and safety of esta strategy must be further EVALUATED in clinical studies. © 2011 American Heart Association, Inc.;STROKE;2011;Artículo;Clinical neurology;0;hematoma;dabigatran;ich;plasma;prevent;;0;0;0;13;6;12;10;14;38
1098;417;Comparative Effectiveness of Hemostatic Therapy in Experimental Warfarin-Associated Intracerebral Hemorrhage;Background and Purpose-Intracerebral hemorrhage associated With oral anticoagulants have a poor prognosis. Current treatment guidelines are based on case series and plausibility only, and a common consensus on effective hemostatic therapy is missing. We Compared the hemostatic effectiveness of Diverse Approaches in a mouse model of intracerebral hemorrhage warfarin-associated. Methods-Male C57BL / 6 mice received anticoagulant treatment With warfarin (0.4 mg / kg for 3 days). Intracerebral hemorrhage was induced by striatal injection of collagenase, and 30 minutes later, mice received an intravenous injection of saline (200 uL n = 15), prothrombin complex concentrate (100 U / kg, n = 10), fresh-frozen plasma (200 uL, n = 13), recombinant human Factor VII activated (3.5 mg / kg, n = 8 and 10 mg / kg, n = 8), or tranhexamic acid (400 mg / kg, n = 12). Intracerebral hemorrhage volume was Quantified on T2-weighted images after 24 hours. Results-Mean ± 7.4 Were volumes hematoma in the nonwarfarin 1.8 mm3 and 21.9 ± 5.0 controls mm3 in the warfarin group receiving saline. Prothrombin complex concentrate (7.5 ± 2.3 mm3) and fresh-frozen plasma (8.7 ± 2.1) treatment Resulted in Significantly smaller volume hematoma Compared With saline. Recombinant human activated Factor VII (10 mg / kg: 14.7 ± 3.4 3.5 mg / kg: 15.0 ± 6.8 mm3) and tranexamic acid (16.2 ± 4.1 mm3) Were less effective.

1102;610;Long-term Adherence to National Guidelines for Secondary Prevention of Ischemic Stroke: A Prospective Cohort Study in a Public Hospital in Chile;Background: Clinical guidelines for the secondary prevention of ischemic stroke Have Been developed, but Their publication is to make them effective Insufficient. Our aim was to investigate adherence to Chilean guidelines, ITS associated variables, and to determine prognosis at follow-up. Methods: We prospectively included all consecutive Patients discharged with a diagnosis of ischemic stroke from Valparaiso Regional Hospital Between July 15, 2007 and January 15, 2008. Patient follow-up was performed at 5, 10, and 15 months using a standardized questionnaire. We used the Chi-square and Fisher exact tests to compare variables and multivariate logistic discrete regression analysis to adjust for potential confounding factors. A Cox regression model was fitted. Results: We included 156 Patients 128 Patients (82%) completed follow-up. Adherence to oral anticoagulation Decreased Significantly all other medications Compared To During follow-up (P = 0.004). This was not associated With any of the Studied variables. Adherence to antihypertensives, statins, and hypoglycemic medications Remained> 65% without a significant variation. Patients With cardioembolic stroke HAD greater mortality (P = .003) and recurrence rates. Conclusions: The Observed significant decrease in adherence to oral anticoagulation in Patients With cardioembolic stroke Suggests a need for the implementation of specific strategies to Achieve the Desired goals in secondary prevention These patients. Future research into the evaluation of other factors That Could be Associated With the lack of adherence to These guidelines, measurements of therapeutic goals, and new therapeutic strategies That are Easier to use and That are associated with Less risk could improve the prognosis of These patients. © 2014 by National Stroke Association.;JOURNAL OF STROKE & CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASES;2014;Artículo;Clinical neurology;0;adher;stroke;follow;guidelin;variabl;;0;0;0;9;8;9;1;30;25
1103;710;Local infiltration of gonyautoxin is safe and effective in treatment of chronic tension-type headache;Background: Gonyautoxin are phycotoxins, Whose molecular mechanism of action is a reversible block of the voltage-gated sodium channels at axonal level, impeding nerve impulse propagation. Objective: To Evaluate clinical efficacy of gonyautoxin in the treatment of Patients With chronic tension-type headache. Methods: Open trial from September 2004 to 2005 in University of Chile Clinical Hospital. Twenty-seven Patients With chronic stress-type headache Were locally infiltrated With gonyautoxins (50 micrograms) in ten sites Considered as pain trigger points in a fixed protocol infiltration. In each site, a volume of 200 microlitres was injected. EMG recording was performed before and after Immediately infiltrations. Main Outcome Measures are WHERE a drop-off in Significantly acute headache pain score OCCURS and number of days without headache pain. Results: No side effects Were detected in the follow-up period. From line basis of 2 weeks, 19 Patients of 27 (70%) are the responders to the treatment successfully. They Showed the remarkable immediate effect after infiltration Demonstrated by trapezium EMG recording. Patients reported almost to fall in pain score 5 minutes post-injection from 5.0 ± 2.8 to 1.6 ± 1.6 (mean ± SD). The answer Showed an average of 8.1 ± 9.9 weeks of headache pain-free, all of them without a second infiltration or use of any additional analgesic medication. Discussion: The therapeutic properties of the local gonyautoxin infiltration in chronic stress-type headache Patients are shown to be safe and effective. This report describe a new therapy for chronic stress-type headache Involving Local infiltrations of gonyautoxins. The immediate headache pain relief effect shown only minutes after toxin infiltrations Were The most remarkable feature of esta protocol.

1104;730;Blood pressure variability and outcome after acute intracerebral haemorrhage: a post-hoc analysis of INTERACT2, a randomised controlled trial;Background: High blood pressure is a prognostic factor for acute stroke, but blood pressure variability Might Also Independently predict outcome. We Assessed the prognostic value of blood pressure variability in participants of INTERACT2, an open-label randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00716079). Methods: 2839 enrolled INTERACT2 spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage Adults with (ICH) and high systolic blood pressure (150-220 mm Hg) without a definite indication or contraindication to early intensive treatment to reduce blood pressure. Participants Were randomly Assigned to intensive treatment (target systolic blood pressure & lt 140 mm Hg Within 1 h using locally available intravenous drugs) or guideline-recommended treatment (target systolic blood pressure & lt 180 mm Hg) Within 6 hours of onset of ICH. The primary outcome was death or major disability at 90 days (modified Rankin Scale score =3) and the secondary outcome was an ordinal modified Rankin Scale shift in scores at 90 days, Assessed by masked to treatment allocation Investigators. Blood pressure variability was defined ACCORDING TO standard criteria: five measurements taken in the first Were 24 h (hyperacute phase) and 12 over 2-7 days (acute phase). We Between Estimated associations blood pressure variability and outcomes With logistic regression and proportional odds models. The key parameter for blood pressure variability was standard deviation (SD) of systolic blood pressure, categorised into quintiles. Findings: We Studied 2645 (93 · 2%) participants in the hyperacute phase and 2347 (82 · 7%) in the acute phase. Both in cohorts combined treatment, systolic blood pressure of SD had a significant linear association with the primary outcome for the hyperacute phase Both (highest quintile adjusted OR 1 · 41, 95% CI 1 · 05-1 · 90 Ptrend = · 0167) and the acute phase (highest quintile adjusted OR 1 · 57, 95% CI 1 · 14-2 · 17 Ptrend = · 0124). The strongest predictors of outcome maximum systolic blood pressure Were in the hyperacute phase and SD of systolic blood pressure in the acute phase. Were Similar associations for the secondary outcome (for the hyperacute phase, highest quintile adjusted OR 1 · 43, 95% CI 1 · 14-1 · 80 Ptrend = · 0014 for the acute phase OR 1 · 46, 95% CI 1 · 13-1 · 88 Ptrend = · 0044). Interpretation: Systolic blood pressure variability Seems to predict a poor outcome in acute intracerebral haemorrhage Patients With. The benefits of early treatment to reduce systolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg to be enhanced by Might smooth and sustained control by Avoiding peaks and Particularly in systolic blood pressure. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.;LANCET NEUROLOGY;2014;Artículo;Clinical neurology;0;blood;pressur;phase;systol;outcom;blood;61;11;0.0135314995563443;13;8;8;10;14;25

1106;929;Plasma urate in REM sleep behavior disorder;Background: Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is associated with a high risk of developing Parkinson's disease (PD). Higher urate levels are associated with a lower risk of PD. We Conducted a study to Evaluate plasma urate levels in Patients With RBD and Their role in the development of PD. Methods: We EVALUATED plasma urate levels in a cohort of 24 Patients With idiopathic RBD. Patients Were divided into 2 groups to the presence or ACCORDING absence of PD. Other Known markers of the risk of developing PD, Such as olfaction testing, substantia nigra and (SN) hyperechogenicity, EVALUATED Were in the two groups. Results: No Differences Were Observed Regarding age, years of evolution of the RBD, SN hyperechogenicity, or plasma urate levels Between the two groups. In Patients without PD, there was a positive correlation Between years of evolution of RBD and the levels of uric acid (R2 = 0.88). Patients without PD and Those Who Had more than 5 years of RBD exhibited higher levels of uric acid than Patients With PD (P = 0.02). Conclusions: Higher levels of plasma urate Were associated with a longer duration of RBD without converting to PD. Future prospective studies would be needed to confirm esta finding.

1107;1051;Incidence of Lobar and Non-Lobar Spontaneous Intracerebral Haemorrhage in a Predominantly Hispanic-Mestizo Population - The PISCIS Stroke Project: A Community-Based Prospective Study in Iquique, Chile;Background: The incidence of intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) in Hispanics is high, especially of non-lobar ICH. Our aim was to ascertain the incidence of first prospectively-ever spontaneous ICH (SICH) stratified by localization in a Hispanic-Mestizo population of the north of Chile. Methods: Between July 2000 and June 2002 all possible cases of ICH Were ascertained from multiple overlapping sources. The cases Were Allocated ACCORDING TO localization. With vascular malformations Those non-identifiable or localisations Were excluded. Results: We Identified to the total of 69 cases of first-ever ICH. Of these, 64 (92.7%) ADH SICH, Of which we Allocated 58 cases (84%) to non-lobar or lobar localization. The mean age was 57.3 ± 17 years, and 62.3% of the subjects Were male. The age-adjusted incidence rates Were 13.8 (non-lobar) and 4.9 (lobar) per 100,000 person-years. Non-lobar SICH was more frequent in young males and lobar SICH in older women. The non-lobar-to-lobar ratio was similar to previous findings in Hispanics. Hypertension was more frequent in non-lobar SICH and in diabetes, heavy drinking and antithrombotic use in lobar SICH, but in none Significantly. There was no association Between localization and prognosis. Conclusions: The incidence of non-lobar SICH was high, but lower than in non-white MOST Populations. This lower incidence Could be due to a lower prevalence of risk factors population, a higher socioeconomic level in esta population, or chance. Copyright © 2 S.

1108;1072;Validity of the NIHSS in predicting arterial occlusion in cerebral infarction is time-dependent;Background: The NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is used to ASSESS acute ischemic stroke severity and outcome. High NIHSS scores are associated With arterial occlusion Usually but it is unknown what the effect of time to clinical evaluation (TTCE) In This association is. We tested the NIHSS scores as an instrument to determine vessel occlusion (VO) at different time points from symptom onset. Methods: Patients Were selected from our prospective database stroke admission NIHSS if They Had scores and neuroimaging studies intracranial vessel. We dichotomized Patients ACCORDING TO VO and TTCE. Receiver operating curves, c statistics, and odds ratios Were Calculated to study the validity of the NIHSS score. Results: Among 463 Patients (mean age 70.2 years, 53.1% male, median NIHSS 4 TTCE median 3.3 hours), 22.5% ADH arterial occlusion. Median NIHSS scores Were higher in Patients With VO, 10.5 (interquartile range 5-18) vs. 3 (2-7), p <0.001, and in Those With TTCE <6 hours, 15 (interquartile range 7-19) vs 4 ( 2-8) if =6 hours, p <0.001. Receiver operating characteristic curves Showed That the validity of NIHSS in predicting VO was higher in Patients With TTCE <6 hours, p = 0.03. The best cutoff point in Patients EVALUATED before 6 hours was an NIHSS of 7 (76.2% sensitivity, 70.1% specificity), while in Patients EVALUATED after 6 hours the best cutoff point was 4 (sensitivity 65.4%, specificity 62.0%). Conclusions: Our study shows the validity of NIHSS That scores in predicting arterial occlusion is time-dependent, decreasing With time from symptom onset Increasing to clinical evaluation.

1109;1165;Rapid Blood-Pressure Lowering in Patients with Acute Intracerebral Hemorrhage;BACKGROUND: Whether rapid lowering of elevated blood pressure would improve increase the outcome in Patients With intracerebral hemorrhage is not known. METHODS: We randomly Assigned 2839 Patients Who Had had a intracerebral spontaneous hemorrhage Reviews within the previous 6 hours and Who Had elevated systolic blood pressure to receive intensive treatment to lower Their blood pressure (with a target systolic level of <140 mm Hg Within 1 hour) or guideline-recommended treatment (with a target level of systolic <180 mm Hg) with the use of agents of the physician's choosing. The primary outcome was death or major disability, Which was defined as a score of 3 to 6 on the modified Rankin scale (in Which a score of 0 Indicates no symptoms, a score of 5 Indicates severe disability, and a score of 6 Indicates death ) at 90 days. A prespecified ordinal analysis of the modified Rankin score was Also performed. The rate of serious adverse events was Between the two groups Compared. RESULTS: Among the 2794 participants For Whom the primary outcome Could Be Determined, 719 of 1382 participants (52.0%) receiving intensive treatment, as Compared With 785 of 1412 (55.6%) receiving guideline-recommended treatment, had a primary outcome event (odds With intensive treatment ratio, 0.87 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.75 to 1.01 P = 0.06). The ordinal analysis Showed Significantly lower scores modified Rankin With intensive treatment (odds ratio for greater disability, 0.87 95% CI, 0.77 to 1.00 P = 0.04). Mortality was 11.9% in the group receiving intensive treatment and 12.0% in the group receiving guideline-recommended treatment. Nonfatal adverse events occurred there in serious 23.3% and 23.6% of the Patients in the two groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In Patients With intracerebral hemorrhage, intensive lowering of blood pressure did not result in a significant reduction in the rate of the primary outcome of death or severe disability. An ordinal analysis of modified Rankin scores improved functional outcomes Indicated With intensive lowering of blood pressure.

1110;1296;CEREBROLYSIN IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE;Cerebrolysin is a neuropeptide preparation mimicking the action of endogenous neurotrophic factors. Positive effects of ß-amyloid- Cerebrolysin on and tau-related pathologies, neuroinflammation, neurotrophic factors, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, neurotransmission, brain metabolism, neuroplasticity, neuronal apoptosis and degeneration, neurogenesis and cognition in experimental conditions Were Demonstrated. These pleiotropic effects of Cerebrolysin on Alzheimer's disease-related pathogenic events are consistent with a neurotrophic-like mode of action, and Seems to Involve the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase / Akt / glycogen synthase kinase-3 ß intracellular signaling pathway. The clinical efficacy of Cerebrolysin in Alzheimer's disease was EVALUATED in Several randomized, double-blind, clinical trials, showing consistent benefits overall on clinical function and cognition, improvements in behavior at high doses, and minor effects on daily living activities in Patients With Mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, as well as in Subgroups of moderate to moderately severe patients. In Addition, the clinical benefits of Cerebrolysin Were Largely maintained for months after ending treatment Several, That finding supports a discontinuous ITS administration. Cerebrolysin was well tolerated and did Generally not induce significant adverse events in Alzheimer's patients. , Although long-term studies are needed, the data available Cerebrolysin Suggest That is effective as monotherapy and constitutes a promising option for combined therapy in Alzheimer's disease.

1111;1471;Perinatal asphyxia: current status and approaches towards neuroprotective strategies, with focus on sentinel proteins;Delivery is a stressful and risky event menacing the newborn. The mother-dependent respiration has to be Replaced by autonomous Immediately after breathing pulmonary delivery. If delayed, it May lead to deficient oxygen supply survival and development Compromising of the Central nervous system. Lack of oxygen availability Gives rise to depletion of NAD + tissue stores, decrease of ATP formation, weakening of the electron transport pump and anaerobic metabolism and acidosis, leading to death Necessarily if oxygenation is not promptly re-established. Re-oxygenation triggers a cascade of biochemical events to restore compensatory function, Which May be Accompanied by homeostasis and oxidative stress improper. Consequences May be incomplete recovery, excess or biological reactions That worsen the outcome by Disturbed metabolism and / or imbalance produced by over-expression of alternative metabolic pathways. Perinatal asphyxia Has Been Associated With severe neurological and psychiatric sequelae With clinical onset delayed. No specific treatments Have Been established yet. In the clinical setting, resuscitation of an infant after birth asphyxia With, the emphasis is on supportive therapy. Several interventions Have Been Proposed to attenuate secondary neuronal injuries elicited by asphyxia, Including hypothermia. , Although promising, the clinical efficacy of hypothermia has not Been Demonstrated fully. It is evident That New approaches are warranted. The purpose of this review is to discuss the concept of sentinel proteins as targets for neuroprotection. Several sentinel proteins Have Been Described to protect the integrity of the genome (e.g. PARP-1 XRCC1 IIIa DNA ligase, DNA polymerase ß, ERCC2, DNA-dependent protein kinases). They act by eliciting metabolic cascades leading to (i) activation of cell survival and neurotrophic pathways (Ii) early and delayed programmed cell death, and (iii) promotion of cell proliferation, differentiation, neuritogenesis and synaptogenesis. It is Proposed That can be used sentinel proteins as markers for characterising long-term effects of perinatal asphyxia, and as targets for novel therapeutic strategies for development and neonatal care innovative. © Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2.;NEUROTOXICITY RESEARCH;2011;Artículo;Clinical neurology;0;asphyxia;metabol;oxygen;protein;clinic;clinic;137;3;0.0303904170363798;5;5;5;8;11;32

1126;2930;Cancer linked to Alzheimer disease but not vascular dementia;Objective: To investigate Whether cancer is associated With Alzheimer disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD). METHODS: Cox proportional hazards models Were used to test associations Between prevalent dementia and risk of future cancer hospitalization, and cancer associations Between prevalent and risk of subsequent dementia. Participants in the Cardiovascular Health Cognition Study-Substudy, a prospective cohort study, aged 65 years or older (n = 3,020) Were followed a mean of 5.4 years and 8.3 years for dementia for cancer. RESULTS: The presence of any AD (AD + puree mixed AD / VaD hazard ratio [HR] = 0.41, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.20 to 0.84) and pure AD (HR = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.12- 0.86) was associated with a reduced risk of future cancer hospitalization, adjusted for demographic factors, smoking, obesity, and physical activity. Were not found significant associations Between dementia at baseline and rate of hospitalizations for cancer diagnoses of participants With VaD. Prevalent cancer was reduced risk of associated With any AD (HR = 0.72 95% CI = 0.52-0997) and pure AD (HR = 0.57 95% CI = 0.36 to 0.90) Among white subjects after adjustment for demographics, number of APOE e4 alleles, hypertension, diabetes, and coronary heart disease the opposite association was found Among minorities, but the sample size was too small to Provide stable estimates. No significant association was found Between cancer and subsequent development of VaD. CONCLUSIONS: In white older adults, prevalent Alzheimer disease (AD) was associated with a reduced longitudinally risk of cancer, and a history of cancer was associated with a reduced risk of AD. Together with other work showing cancer and Parkinson associations Between disease, These findings Suggest the Possibility That cancer is linked to neurodegeneration. © 2 by AAN Enterprises, Inc.

1128;3190;Protective Effects of Nicotine Against Aminochrome-Induced Toxicity in Substantia Nigra Derived Cells: Implications for Parkinson's Disease;Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder debilitating That results from the loss of or damage to dopaminergic cells in the substantia Containing neuromelanin nigra (SN). The underlying neurodegenerative mechanism (s), however, REMAIN elusive. Aminochrome, the precursor of neuromelanin is an endogenous substance capable of inducing selective dopaminergic neurotoxicity to neurons in SN. Nicotine, on the other hand, may offer protective effects against dopaminergic cell damage induced by MPTP Including various neurotoxins and salsolinol. In This study, we Sought to determine Whether protect against nicotine May Also aminochromeinduced toxicity in SN NSCJ-3 derived cells. Exposure of NSCJ-3 cells to a combination of aminochrome (50 uM) and dicoumarol (50 uM) for 48 h induced approximately 70% cell death. Pretreatment With nicotine, dose-dependently blocked esta toxicity. The effects of nicotine in dose-dependently Were turn blocked by mecamylamine, a nicotinic receptor nonselective antagonist.

The U373MG-conditioned medium container containing SH-SY5Y GSTM2 Protects cells incubated With 10 uM aminochrome. The significant protection provided by U373MG-conditioned medium in SH-SY5Y cells incubated With aminochrome was dependent on GSTM2 internalization into SH-SY5Y cells as evidenced by (i) uptake of 14C-GSTM2 released from U373MG cells into SH-SY5Y cells, a process inhibited by anti-GSTM2 antiserum (Ii) lack of protection of U373MG-conditioned medium in the presence of anti-GSTM2 antiserum on SH-SY5Y cells Treated With aminochrome and (iii) lack of protection of conditioned medium from U373MGsiGST6 That Expresses an siRNA directed against GSTM2 on SH-SY5Y cells Treated With aminochrome. In conclusion, our results Demonstrated That U373MG SH-SY5Y cells protect cells against neurotoxicity by releasing GSTM2 aminochrome into the conditioned medium and subsequent internalization of GSTM2 into SH-SY5Y cells.

1138;4396;Exogenous orienting of visual-spatial attention in ADHD children;Visual spatial orienting of attention towards exogenous cues has-been one of the attentional functions Considered to be spared in ADHD. Here we present a design in Which 60 (30 ADHD) children, age: 10.9 ± 1.4, Were Asked to covertly orient Their attention to one or two (out of four) cued locations, and search for a target stimulus in One of These locations , while recording behavioral responses and EEG / ERP. In all conditions, ADHD children Showed delayed reaction times and Poorer behavioral performance. They Also exhibited larger cue-elicited P2 but reduced CNV in the preparation stage. Larger amplitude of CNV Predicted better performance in the task. Target-elicited N1 and selection negativity Were Also reduced in the ADHD group Compared to non-ADHD. Also groups differed in the early and late time-windows P3. The present results Suggest That exogenous orienting of attention Could be dysfunctional in ADHD under Certain conditions.

Interestingly, These compounds, with applications in the medical Important treatment of allergies and gastrointestinal disorders respectively, bind Specifically to aggregated variants of tau protein and paired helical filaments to isolated from brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. These ligands Appear to be a powerful tool to tag isolated brain-tau-aggregates and heparin-induced polymers of recombinant tau. The interactions of AST and LNS With tau aggregates Were Assessed by classical radioligand assays, surface plasmon resonance, bioinformatic and Approaches. The affinity of AST and LNS for tau aggregates was higher than Comparatively amyloid-ß That for polymers ACCORDING to our data. This is since senile plaques are Relevant Also abundant but are not pathognomonic in AD patients. Immunochemical studies on paired helical filaments from brains of AD Patients and surface plasmon resonance studies These findings confirm. The capacity of These drugs to penetrate the blood-brain barrier was EVALUATED: i) in vitro by artificial membrane permeability assay parallel followed by experimental log P Determinations and ii) in vivo pharmacokinetic studies by Comparing distribution profiles in blood and brain of mice using HPLC / UV. Importantly, our studies Indicate That the brain / blood concentration ratios for These compounds Were suitable for use as PET radiotracers Their. Neurofibrillary tangles are positively since Correlated With cognitive impairment, we Concluded That LNS and AST have a great potential in PET neuroimaing for in vivo early detection of AD and in reducing the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. © 2 - IOS Press and the authors.

1140;4481;Increased Susceptibility to Oxidative Death of Lymphocytes from Alzheimer Patients Correlates with Dementia Severity;We Previously Reported on enhanced susceptibility to death of lymphocytes from Alzheimer's disease (AD) Patients When exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) -induced oxidative stress and an Increased resistance to death in Those of Patients with a history of skin cancer. This is consistent With our hypothesis That proposing the cellular machinery controlling cell death is deregulated in opposite directions in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cancer, to Explain the inverse association in epidemiological studies Observed. Here we Investigated Whether the Observed Increased susceptibility Correlates With the degree of dementia severity. Peripheral lymphocytes from 23 AD Patients, classified using the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) into severe dementia (CDR 3, n = 10) and mild-to-moderate dementia (CDR 1 2, n = 13), and 15 healthy controls ( HC) (CDR 0) Were exposed to H2O2 for 20 hours. Lymphocyte was determined to death by flow cytometry and propidium iodide staining. The greatest susceptibility to H2O2-induced death was Observed for lymphocytes from severe dementia Patients, Whereas Those With Mild-to-moderate dementia exhibited intermediate values, Compared to healthy controls. A significant Increase in the apoptosis / necrosis ratio was found in AD patients. Poly (ADP-ribosyl) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) protected from inhibition Significantly H2O2-induced death of lymphocytes, whereby to lower degree of protection was Observed in severe AD patients. , Moreover, inhibition of PARP-1 abolished the Differences in apoptosis / necrosis ratios Observed Between the three groups of patients. These results support the notion That AD is a systemic disorder, whereby enhanced susceptibility to H2O2-induced death in peripheral lymphocytes Correlates With dementia severity and enhanced death in AD Patients is attributable to a PARP-dependent apoptosis in the Increase / necrosis ratio. © 2014 Bentham Science Publishers.;CURRENT ALZHEIMER RESEARCH;2014;Artículo;Clinical neurology;0;death;dementia;lymphocyt;observ;sever;;0;0;0;5;5;5;8;11;10
1086;4124;Prescription Patterns of Psychotropic Medications for the Treatment of Psychotic Disorders in the Largest Mental Health Institutions of Uganda;The study describe prescription patterns of psychotropic medications for Patients Treated for Psychosis in psychiatric hospitals of Uganda. A quantitative cross-sectional survey of age, sex, diagnoses, and psychotropic medication of 682 psychiatric inpatients of the two national referral hospitals in Uganda was Conducted on one day in March 2012. The percentage of Patients Treated With The same substance Within the diagnostic categories schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, unspecified psychosis, depressive disorder and was Calculated. Close to 90% of the diagnosed conditions Patients With With any psychotic disorder Were Treated With first-generation antipsychotic drugs (eg, chlorpromazine, haloperidol, trifluoperazine, fluphenazine and depot). Carbamazepine in combination With first-generation antipsychotics was prescribed Frequently (45%) for the treatment of bipolar affective disorder. The use of second-generation antipsychotics, lithium, valproic acid and was exceptional. Patients with depression Usually a received combination (63%) of first-generation antipsychotics and antidepressants (amitriptyline or Fluoxetine). Benzodiazepines Were used only infrequently diagnosed for Patients With psychoses. First-generation antipsychotics, antidepressants, and carbamazepine Were the Most Frequently used medications for treatment of psychosis in Uganda. Lithium and valproic acid, Although Were on the Essential Drug List in Uganda, Their use was still infrequent. There is a need to Ensure the practical availability of the drugs listed on the Essential Drug List and to support the implementation of Their use in clinical practice. © 2014 by Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.;JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY;2014;Artículo;Clinical psycology;0;antipsychot;generat;disord;drug;uganda;;0;0;0;14;8;12;1;12;6
1075;2244;Impact of emergency intubation on central venous oxygen saturation in critically ill patients: a multicenter observational study;Introduction: Central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) you Emerged as an Important Goal for critically ill resuscitation patients. NEVERTHELESS, ITS growing Concerns About perfused parameter limitations as Expressed Have Been Recently, Including the uncommon finding of low ScvO2 values <U+200B><U+200B>in Patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Emergency intubation May induce strong and divergent effects on the Eventually physiologic determinants of oxygen transport (DO2) and oxygen consumption (VO2) and, THUS, on ScvO2. THEREFORE, we Conducted a study to determine the impact of emergency intubation on ScvO2. Methods: In this prospective observational study multicenter, we included 103 non-septic and septic Patients with a Central venous catheter in place and in Whom emergency intubation was required. A common protocol was used intubation and we EVALUATED ScvO2 Including Several parameters before and 15 minutes after emergency intubation. Statistical analysis included chi-square test and t test. Results: Increased from 61.8 ScvO2 ± 68.9 ± 12.6% to 12.2%, with no Difference between septic and non-septic patients. ScvO2 Increased in 84 Patients (81.6%) without changes in blood correlation to oxygen saturation (SaO2). Seventy eight (75.7%) Patients intubated Were ScvO2 With less than 70% and 21 (26.9%) normalized the parameter after the intervention. Only Patients With pre-intubation ScvO2 more than 70% failed to Increase the parameter after intubation. Conclusions: ScvO2 Increases Significantly in response to emergency intubation in the majority of septic and non-septic patients. When interpreting ScvO2 During early resuscitation, it is crucial to Consider Whether the patient has-been recently or is spontaneously breathing intubated. © 2009 Hernandez et al . licensee BioMed Central Ltd.;CRITICAL CARE;2009;Artículo;Critical care medicine;0;scvo;intub;emerg;septic;includ;;0;0;0;13;6;12;10;2;33

1078;2964;A pilot, randomized, controlled clinical trial of lucinactant, a peptide-containing synthetic surfactant, in infants with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure;OBJECTIVE :: Inhibition of surfactant function and lead to abnormal synthesis Surfactant Surfactant dysfunction in Children with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. We EVALUATED Whether lucinactant intratracheal, to synthetic, peptide-container containing surfactant, was safe and well-tolerated in infants With hypoxemic acute respiratory failure, and Assessed effects on clinical outcomes STI. METHODS AND MAIN RESULTS :: Infants =2 yrs of Age With hypoxemic acute respiratory failure Were enrolled in a phase II, double-blind, multinational, randomized placebo-controlled trial across pediatric intensive care units 36. Infants Requiring mechanical ventilation With persistent hypoxemia meeting acute lung injury criteria Were randomized to receive intratracheal lucinactant (175 mg / kg) or placebo air. One retreatment was allowed 12 to 24 hrs after initial dosing if hypoxemia persisted. Peri-dosing and tolerability of intratracheal Lucinactant Were Assessed adverse experiences. Mechanical ventilation duration was Analyzed using analysis of variance. The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test was used for categorical variables.We 165 infants enrolled (84 lucinactant 81 placebo) With hypoxemic acute respiratory failure. There Were no significant Differences in Baseline Characteristics subject, with the exception of a lower positive end-expiratory pressure and tidal volume higher in placebo subjects. The incidence of peri-transient bradycardia and desaturation dosing was Significantly higher in the treatment group Lucinactant. There Were no statistical Differences Between groups for other adverse events or mortality. Oxygenation improved in infants randomized to receive lucinactant as Indicated by fewer second treatments (67% vs. 81% lucinactant placebo, p = .02) and a trend in improvement in partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood to fraction of inspired oxygen from eligibility to 48 hrs after dose (p = .06). There was no significant reduction in duration of mechanical ventilation With lucinactant (geometric least square means: 4.0 days vs. 4.5 days lucinactant placebo p = 0.254). In a subset of infants (n = 22), the duration of mechanical ventilation in Children with acute lung injury (partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood to fraction of inspired oxygen> 200) was Significantly shorter With lucinactant (least square means: 2.4 days lucinactant vs. placebo 4.3 days p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS :: In mechanically ventilated infants With hypoxemic acute respiratory failure, treatment lucinactant intratracheal With Appeared to be safe Generally. An improvement in oxygenation and a requirement for retreatment Significantly reduced Lucinactant Suggests That Might Improve lung function in infants With hypoxemic acute respiratory failure. © 2012 by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies.;PEDIATRIC CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE;2012;Artículo;Critical care medicine;0;lucinact;acut;infant;placebo;failur;;0;0;0;13;8;9;10;1;35
1079;2965;Impact of syringe size on the performance of infusion pumps at low flow rates;OBJECTIVE :: To Evaluate the impact of syringe size on start-up delay and the time to reach 50% and 90% of target flow rates, using two commercially available syringe infusion pumps at infusion rates of =1 mL / hr. DESIGN :: Two syringes (Terumo) of different size (10-mL and 50-mL), using two syringe infusion pumps (Pump A, Terumo Terufusion Infusion Pump TE-331, and Pump B, Braun Perfusor Compact S) Were Studied. Effective fluid delivery was Measured at 0.4 mL / hr, 0.8 mL / hr, and 1.0 mL / hr for the initial 60 mins, using the gravimetric method. Instant flow volume difference was as Calculated for every 1-min interval per minute. Start-up delay time was defined as 0 in minutes of flow from the start of infusion. Syringe placement, bubble removal, priming infusion line, and positioning Were standardized for all measurements, using new syringes and infusion lines. Each experiment was six times Repeated. Statistical analysis was performed, using a nonparametric test (Mann-Whitney U test). SETTING :: None. PATIENTS :: None. INTERVENTIONS :: None. RESULTS :: Using the 50-mL syringe, the start-up delay was consistently higher and the time to reach 50% and 90% of target Were Significantly longer flow, independent of Which syringe infusion pump was used. Studied at every flow rate, the pumps did not reach the target flow rate 60 mins before the 50-mL With syringe. With the 10-mL syringe, target flow rate was 20 mins before Achieved for Both pumps. CONCLUSIONS :: Our findings Demonstrate to Clinically Relevant impact of syringe size on syringe infusion pump performance at low flow rates. The time to reach 50% and 90% of target flow are Significantly longer, using the 50-mL syringe Compared With the 10-mL syringe, and the time to reach 50% of target flow is independent of the longer start-up delay. Based on our findings, we speculate That smaller syringe sizes and higher infusion rates are preferable for continuous drug infusions, Particularly When the prompt establishment of drug effect is critical. © 2 by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies.;PEDIATRIC CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE;2010;Artículo;Critical care medicine;0;syring;infus;flow;pump;target;;0;0;0;13;6;12;10;25;33
1080;3006;Extended prone position ventilation in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome: A pilot feasibility study;Objectives: The aim of the study was to Evaluate the safety of extended prone position ventilation (PPV) and Its Impact on respiratory function in Patients With Severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Design: This was a prospective interventional study. Setting: Patients Were Recruited from a mixed medical-surgical intensive care unit in a university hospital. Patients: Fifteen consecutive Patients With Severe ARDS, unresponsive to positive Previously end-expiratory pressure adjustment, Were Treated With PPV. Intervention: Prone position ventilation for 48 hours or the oxygenation index was Until 10 or less (extended PPV). Results: The elapsed time from the initiation of mechanical ventilation to pronation was 35 ± 11 hours. Prone position ventilation was maintained for 55 ± Continuously 7 hours. Two grade II Patients developed pressure ulcers of small extent. None of the Patients experienced life-threatening complications or hemodynamic instability During the procedure. The Patients Showed a statistically significant improvement in PaO2 / FiO2 (92 ± 12 vs 227 ± 43, P & lt 0.0001) and oxygenation index (22 ± 5 vs 8 ± 2, P & lt 0.0001) reduction of PaCO2 (54 ± 9 vs 39 ± 4, P & lt 0.0001) and plateau pressure (32 ± 2 vs 27 ± 3 P & lt 0.0001), and increment of the static compliance (21 ± 3 vs 37 ± 6, P & lt .0001) with extended PPV. All the parameters continued to Improve Significantly While They Remained in prone position and did not change upon returning to the supine Patients the position. Conclusions: The results Obtained Suggest That extended PPV is safe and effective in Patients With Severe ARDS when it is Carried out by a trained staff and an established protocol Within. Extended PPV is emerging as an effective therapy in the rescue of Patients from severe ARDS. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

1081;3020;Postmortem studies in the contemporary pediatric intensive care unit;Objectives: To describe the implementation of an educational program That Achieved With high compliance autopsy requests and consents in a pediatric intensive care unit. Concordance Between To Evaluate the clinical diagnoses and autopsy findings and to Identify Patient Characteristics in Which postmortem diagnosis elucidated the primary disease process. Design: Retrospective, observational study. Setting: A pediatric intensive care unit in a tertiary care teaching hospital. Patients: All pediatric intensive care unit Patients With autopsy reports from 2000 to 2005. Interventions: An educational program and protocol Were Initiated in 1995-1996 to raise awareness and formalize the process for autopsy request. From 2000 to 2005, data from medical records Were Collected pathology department and autopsy reports. Premortem and postmortem diagnoses Were Compared utilizing the modified Goldman's classification. The associations of Goldman's classification with age of length of stay and Patients Were explored. Measurements and Main Results: After the educational program was instituted, an autopsy rate of> 50% was attained Compared to 20% -30% in previous years (p <.05). From 2000 to 2005, 139 Were autopsies performed. In 111 Patients (79.8%), complete concordance of premortem diagnoses and postmortem was found in 22 cases (16%), there was no concordance and in six cases the postmortem studies failed to Explain the mechanism of death. Autopsies provided new and pertinent findings in 47.5% of all studies, with histologic information accounting for 58% of them. A short length of relationship Between stay and the presence of autopsy findings Elucidating the main disease process was found (p <.05). Conclusions: It is feasible to produce a Sustainable Increase in the rate of postmortem studies Within an organization. Autopsy results added new information to almost half of the Patients, Particularly Those Who died soon after admission. A pediatric intensive care unit strategy to Increase and Maintain Compliance With requests is an Important Autopsy Practice with positive clinical and educational repercussions. © 2011 by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies.;PEDIATRIC CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE;2011;Artículo;Critical care medicine;0;autopsi;care;intens;pediatr;postmortem;;0;0;0;14;1;14;1;1;6

1085;3588;Oxidative stress as a novel target in pediatric sepsis management;With Sepsis secondary multisystem organ dysfunction syndrome is the leading cause of death in the pediatric intensive care unit. May Increased reactive oxygen species and endothelial cells circulating influence, contributing to inflammatory tissue injury and tissue hypoxia explaining the paradigm based on microvascular dysfunction. An impaired mitochondrial cellular oxygen utilization, rather than Inadequate oxygen delivery, was Claimed to play a more Important role in the development of multisystem organ dysfunction syndrome. Anyway, it seems, plausible That reactive oxygen species can mediate the pathophysiologic Processes occurring in sepsis. However, the Consensus Guidelines for the Management of Patients With These conditions do not include the enhancement of antioxidant potential. THEREFORE, further investigation is needed to support interventions Aimed to attenuate the severity of the systemic compromise by abrogating the mechanism of oxidative damage. Antioxidant supplementation Currently in use Lacks a mechanistic support. Specific pharmacologic targets, or as mitochondria Such Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phospate-Oxidase (NADPH) oxidase system, need to be explored. Furthermore, the early recognition of oxidative damage in seriously ill These Patients and the usefulness of oxidative stress biomarkers to define a cut point for more successful therapeutic interventions to be instituted antioxidant would offer a new strategy to Improve the outcome of critically ill children. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.;JOURNAL OF CRITICAL CARE;2011;Artículo;Critical care medicine;0;oxygen;antioxid;dysfunct;oxid;damag;;0;0;0;13;5;13;8;17;32

1044;226;Use of Human Mesenchymal Cells to Improve Vascularization in a Mouse Model for Scaffold-Based Dermal Regeneration;All bioartificial engineered structures developed for tissue regeneration requires oxygen and nutrients to Establish proper physiological functions. Aiming to Improve dermal vascularization During regeneration, we combined the use of a bioartificial scaffold and collagen to human mesenchymal cell defined (MC) line. This cell line, termed V54 / 2, morphologic and immunohistochemical exhibits typical Characteristics of MC. V54 / 2 cells seeded in the scaffold Were able to survive, proliferate, and secrete significant Amounts of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) During 2 weeks in vitro. To induce dermal regeneration, scaffolds without cells Were With or transplanted in nude mice to full skin defect model. After 2 weeks of transplantation, scaffolds seeded With V54 / 2 cells Showed more vascularization During the dermal regeneration process than controls, and the presence of human cells in the regenerating tissue was detected by immunohistochemistry. To confirm if the local presence of angiogenic growth factors to induce neovascularization is sufficient, scaffolds Were VEGF and bFGF With loaded and used to induce dermal regeneration in vivo. Results Showed That Supplemented with growth factors scaffolds Were significantly more vascularized than Control scaffolds (without growth factors scaffolds). The present work Suggests That combined use of MC and bioartificial scaffolds induces therapeutic angiogenesis During the scaffold-based dermal regeneration process. © 2009, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.;TISSUE ENGINEERING PART A;2009;Artículo;Dermatology;0;scaffold;regener;dermal;factor;growth;;0;0;0;12;6;12;6;3;36

1055;997;The Use of Adipose Tissue-Derived Stem Cells within a Dermal Substitute Improves Skin Regeneration by Increasing Neoangiogenesis and Collagen Synthesis;BACKGROUND: Surgical treatment of injuries loss of skin tissue With've improved With the advent of Significantly regenerative medicine and tissue bioengineering, and the use of stem cells and dermal substitutes. The success of tissue regeneration depends on the local optimal vascularization and the successful integration of the artificial skin. The present study combine the use of autologous adipose-derived stem cells with a commercially available dermal substitute (Integra) for skin regeneration. METHODS: Adipose-derived stem cells Were isolated from the inguinal region of eight Sprague-Dawley adult rats, seeded onto a piece of dermal substitute for 48 hours, and then a implanted into the same rat, followed by comparison of the evolution with a contralateral implant without adipose-derived stem cells. After 1, 2, and 3 weeks of regeneration in vivo implants for histologic evaluation Were removed. RESULTS: Adipose-derived stem cells adhere properly to the dermal matrix, and tissue integration in the autologous rat was good. The histologic evaluation Showed That adipose-derived stem cells Significantly Increased microvascular density (7.7 ± 0.6 percent versus 5.3. ± 0.5 percent, as Assessed by immunohistochemical staining of factor VIII) and the synthesis of collagen type I (24 ± 3 percent versus 16 ± 2 percent, as Assessed by Sirius red staining). , Although there was greater epithelialization on the side Treated With adipose-derived stem cells (2530 ± 939 vs. 1911 ± 763 microns microns), as Assessed by immunohistochemistry staining anticytokeratin 34ßE12, This difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' data Suggest That the seeding of adipose-derived stem cells onto a dermal skin substitute Improves regeneration and tissue integration by Increasing vascularity and collagen synthesis. Further studies are complete epithelialization Necessary to Achieve With the use of adipose-derived stem cells.

1057;1324;Increased Skin Cancer Mortality in Chile Beyond the Effect of Ageing: Temporal Analysis 1990 to 2005;Chile has a medium-to-high skin cancer mortality rate. Previous studies Have shown an increase increasing mortality rate of skin cancer. We EVALUATED skin cancer mortality Characteristics and Their temporal evolution in Chile from 1990 to 2005 in a mixed ecological study using death certificate databases. Age, sex, year and region of residence Were Obtained for melanoma and non-melanoma deaths. Crude and age-sex-adjusted rates Were Calculated using the national standard WHO 2000 projections and population data. Descriptive and temporal analyzes, using a regression Prais-Winsten, Were computed. A Total of 3,588 deaths Were registered, Of which 55% and 54% Were melanoma occurred in men (median age 71 years women older Were). The adjusted rate was 1.75 per 100,000 inhabitants deaths (22.02 in men vs. 1.39 in women). Melanoma skin cancer and non-melanoma skin cancer mortality had a tendency to increase. In conclusion, skin cancer mortality rate is rising beyond the Predicted by aging. An Increased incidence due to changes in modifiable factors, Such as exposure to ultraviolet radiation and arsenic, might Explain the Increase in skin cancer mortality. © 2 The Authors.;ACTA DERMATO-VENEREOLOGICA;2010;Artículo;Dermatology;0;cancer;skin;mortal;melanoma;age;age;151;2;0.0334960070984916;1;8;7;1;30;6
1058;1367;The use of glandular-derived stem cells to improve vascularization in scaffold-mediated dermal regeneration;Clinical success in tissue regeneration capacity requires improvements in vascularization of scaffolds. Several Efforts Have Been In This Field made cellular and acellular Including technologies. In This work we combined the use of stem cells derived from pancreas or submandibular glands expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP +) with a commercially available scaffold for dermal regeneration. Were Cells isolated, Characterized and seeded in a scaffold for dermal regeneration. Scaffolds container containing cells Were used to induce dermal regeneration in a full skin defect model. After 3 weeks of in vivo regeneration, vascularization and harvested tissues Were was Analyzed. Results Showed That gland-derived stem cells displayed stem cell features and presented multipotential differentiation capacity Because They Were able to differentiate cell types in Representing the 3 different germ layers. After seeding, cells Were homogeneously distributed and focal adhesions FORMED With the scaffold. Showed That Metabolic assays can be cultured cells for at Least 3 weeks in the scaffold. In vivo, the presence of pancreatic or submandibular stem cells Significantly enhanced vascularization Compared to the scaffolds empty. Presence of gland-derived stem cells in the regenerating tissue was confirmed by the detection of GFP expression in the wound area. In order to explore the possible improvement in the Mechanisms behind vascular regeneration, in vitro experiments performed Were, showing That gland-derived stem cells by angiogenic Could Contribute and vasculogenic Mechanisms to this process. Our results Suggest That the combined use of stem cells derived from glands and scaffold for dermal regeneration Could be a rational alternative to Improve vascularization in scaffold-mediated dermal regeneration. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

There is evidence Increasing Microcirculatory Alterations That Might Independently from macrohemodynamic improvement persist and are related to clinical evolution. Future Efforts need to be directed towards microperfusion monitoring and treatment. This study explored the utility of thenar muscle oxygen saturation (StO2) and Its changes During vascular occlusion transient test (VOT) to measure the Microcirculatory response to drotrecogin alfa (activated) (DrotAA) in septic patients. Methods: A prospective, observational study was performed in three generally intensive care units at hospitals three university. We Studied 58 Patients With onset of severe sepsis recent septic shock and or at Least two organ dysfunctions. Thirty-two Patients Were Treated With DrotAA and 26 Were not Treated Because of the formal contraindication. StO2 was Monitored using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), and VOT deoxygenation was performed to obtener (Deox) and reoxygenation (Reox) slopes. Measurements Were Obtained was started and before DrotAA Were Repeated daily for a 96-hour period. Results: Patients' Characteristics, outcome, severity, and baseline values <U+200B><U+200B>of StO2, Deox, and Reox did not differ Between groups. Treated Patients Significantly improved Deox and Reox values <U+200B><U+200B>over time, did not Whereas Patients Control. In Treated Patients, Reox Were improvements correlated to norepinephrine dose reductions. Early clinical response (improvement after 48 hours SOFA of treatment) was not associated to changes in VOT-derived slopes. In the Treated group, the relative improvement of Deox within 48 hours was able to predict mortality (AUC 0.91, p & lt 0.01). Conclusions: In Patients With Severe sepsis or septic shock, DrotAA infusion was associated With improvement in regional tissue oxygenation.

This fact taken into account Should be to determine the MOST to stop resuscitation Appropriate criteria opportunely and avoid the risk of over-resuscitation.Background: The decision of When to stop resuscitation septic shock is a critical but yet unexplored aspect of a Relatively care. This is especially since the Risks of Relevant over-resuscitation with fluid overload or inotropes Have Been Highlighted in recent years. A recent guideline has Normalization of Proposed Central venous oxygen saturation and / or lactate as therapeutic end-points, variables Assuming That These are equivalent or interchangeable. However, since the physiological determinants of both are totally different, it is legitimate to challenge the rationale of esta proposal. We designed this study to gain more insights into the MOST Appropriate resuscitation goal from a dynamic point of view.

Methods: Fourteen (male seven) sedentary, insulin-sensitive participants (mean ± SD: BMI 25 ± 4 kg / m 2 age 39 ± 10 years glucose disposal rate 9.4 ± 2.1 mg [kg body metabolic Estimated size] -1 min -1) and 14 (six male) sedentary, non-diabetic, insulin-resistant volunteers (29 ± 4 kg / m 2 34 ± 13 years 5.3 ± 1.2 mg [kg body metabolic Estimated size] -1 min -1) received after 10 h fast 60 g glucose plus 15 g [6,6- 2 h 2] glucose. Concentrations Serum glucose and insulin, and plasma 2H enrichment gas exchange whole-body glucose ingestion Were Determined before and hourly thereafter for 4 h. Plasma 2H 2 O production is an index of glycolytic disposal. On day 2, participants received a weight-maintenance diet. On day 3, to euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp was performed. Results: Insulin-resistant Individuals ADH About a twofold higher postprandial insulin response than insulin-sensitive Individuals (p = 0.003). Resting metabolic rate was similarly in the two groups before (p = 0.29) and after (p = .33 to .99 over time) glucose ingestion, Whereas a trend for blunted glucose-induced thermogenesis was Observed in insulin-resistant vs insulin-sensitive Individuals ( p = 0.06). However, over the 4 h after the 75g glucose ingestion, glycolytic glucose disposal was the same in insulin-sensitive and insulin-resistant Individuals (36.5 ± 3.7 and 36.2 ± 6.4 mmol, respectively p = 0.99). Similarly, whole-body did not differ carbohydrate oxidation Between the groups Either before or after glucose ingestion (p = 0.41). Conclusions / interpretation: Postprandial hyperinsulinaemia and modest hyperglycaemia insulin resistance Overcome by tissue glucose uptake and Enhancing intracellular glucose utilization. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.;DIABETOLOGIA;2012;Artículo;Endocrinology & metabolism;0;glucos;insulin;resist;individu;bodi;;0;0;0;10;3;5;3;15;30
954;440;Levels of Rabs and WAVE family proteins associated with translocation of GLUT4 to the cell surface in endometria from hyperinsulinemic PCOS women;Background Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine-metabolic disorder associated With highly compensatory hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. It is Known That the insulin signaling pathway is impaired in Endometrial from hyperinsulinemic PCOS women, but no information is available molecules associated with cell acerca surface GLUT4 translocation. We THEREFORE EVALUATED the protein levels of AS160 target molecules, Rab8A and RAB10, and the WAVE family proteins Involved in the cortical-actin remodeling, Neural Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein (N-WASP) and WASP, in endometria from hyperinsulinemic PCOS women and controls . Methods Protein levels Were Assessed by western blot, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence in proliferative (PE = 7) and secretory (SE = 7) Control phase endometria from women and in women endometria from hyperinsulinemic PCOS (PCOS h-INS = 7). Similar results Were detected for RAB10 levels in the three Studied groups however, in SE Rab8A Decreased levels (P <0.05) higher levels while Were Obtained in PCOSE h-INS Compared With PE (P <0.05). In the normal menstrual cycle, Neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP) and WASP levels Were Increased in SE versus PE (P <0.05), but in PCOSE h-INS, the levels Were diminished Compared With PE (P <0.05 ). Characterized by conclusions SE is protein expression changes associated With glucose uptake. In PCOS Women with Endometrial from hyperinsulinemia, reduced levels of WAVE family proteins the cell surface Could compromise and the consequent exposure GLUT4 glucose uptake in esta tissue. © 2 The Author.;HUMAN REPRODUCTION;2010;Artículo;Endocrinology & metabolism;0;protein;pcos;women;wasp;endometria;protein;107;5;0.0237355811889973;10;3;1;3;16;30

956;496;Effects of thyroid hormone on the GH signal transduction pathway;Background / aim: The Importance of thyroid hormone on growth and development in children is well Recognized. In Addition, linear growth is highly dependent on the response of peripheral tissues to growth hormone, a process Known as GH sensitivity, but little is Known About the possible effects of T4 reviews on this process. Methods: We determined to the effect of recombinant human GH stimulation With (rhGH 200 ng / mL) alone or in combination with two different Concentrations of T4 (250 nM and 500 nM for 24 h) on JAK2 and STAT5 activation in Obtained skin fibroblast cultures from prepubertal boys with average height. Results: JAK2 and STAT5 Were activated under co-incubation With T4 (At Both Concentrations) and rhGH in the non-nuclear fraction of the fibroblasts. In Addition, after 24 h of co-incubation With rhGH and T4 (500 nM), we Observed Increase in an phospho-STAT5 in the nuclear fraction, When Compared To GH and T4 stimulation alone. This effect was not Observed When the fibroblasts co-incubated Were With GH and the lower concentration of T4 (250 nM). Conclusion: With Combined GH and T4 stimulation at a concentration of 500 nM Increases nuclear phospho-STAT5 synergistically in skin fibroblasts, Which May amplify sensitivity to GH tissue.

961;738;Haplotype Analysis of the Promoter Region of Phosphodiesterase Type 8B (PDE8B) in Correlation with Inactivating PDE8B Mutation and the Serum Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone Levels;Background: Human phosphodiesterase (PDE) type 8B (PDE8B) is located at 5q14.1 and is Known as the PDE With the highest affinity to cAMP. We described a family We recently bilateral micronodular adrenocortical disease With That was apparently Caused by an inactivating mutation PDE8B (H305P). As a result of a genome-wide study, a strong association Between six polymorphic variants in the promoter PDE8B and serum levels of the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) Has Been Reported recently. DESPITE an extended analysis of the surrounding regions 5q14.1, no other potential genetic variants responsible for That Could be Associated TSH levels were found. Methods: In this study, we genotyped by polymerase chain reaction the described six polymorphic variants in the promoter PDE8B in the family with micronodular adrenocortical disease and inactivating mutation PDE8B and Their correlation Analyzed With single TSH values <U+200B><U+200B>in the family members. Results: We complete segregation Observed Reported Between the association and single TSH values <U+200B><U+200B>in the family we Studied. Haplotype analysis allele Showed That the haplotype associated With the high TSH levels is different from the One That segregated With H305P, suggesting the mutation MOST That probably has arisen on an allele independent of the high TSH-associated. Conclusions: The Proposed mechanism by Which May PDE8B influence TSH levels is through monitoring of cAMP signaling. Our analysis revealed an inactivating separate segregation of PDE8B allele from the high-TSH-allele and Showed low TSH levels in persons inactivating PDE8B WHO carry an allele. These data Suggest That, indeed, PDE8B May be Involved in regulation of TSH levels. © 2 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2.;THYROID;2010;Artículo;Endocrinology & metabolism;0;tsh;pdeb;allel;famili;inactiv;;0;0;0;12;6;19;4;20;9

Objective: To Evaluate two common genetically forms of maturity-onset diabetes of youth (MODY), the short-term prognosis in Children with mild hyperglycemia, and a positive family history of diabetes mellitus. Subjects: Asymptomatic children and adolescents (n = 14), younger than 15 yr, with fasting hyperglycemia, a positive family history of mild non-progressive hyperglycemia, and negative pancreatic autoantibodies Were Studied. Patients and methods: Glucokinase gene (GCK) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha gene (HNF1A) Causing two common forms of MODY Were sequenced. The clinical outcome was EVALUATED after a follow-up period of 2.8 ± 1.3 yr. Results: Were GCK mutations present in seven children. The confirmation of diagnosis esta discontinuation of insulin in allowed two families and oral medications in three families. Mutations of HNF1A Were not detected in any of the families. During the follow-up period, all the GCK mutation carrier Remained asymptomatic children without medication and hemoglobin A1c levels the last Were 6.4 ± 0.7%. In the GCK -negative children (n = 7), one developed T1DM, correspondiente to 7.2% of the total group. Mild fasting hyperglycemia persisted During follow-up in four GCK-negative children and normalized in the remaining two. Conclusions: The presence of mild persistent hyperglycemia in any patient without autoantibodies Should lead to genetic analysis of GCK, if there is a Particularly positive family history. Furthermore, Those without GCK mutations Should be Followed with repeat autoantibody testing, and other genetic types of diabetes Should be Considered if hyperglycemia worsens. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons A / S.;PEDIATRIC DIABETES;2009;Artículo;Endocrinology & metabolism;0;children;gck;hyperglycemia;famili;diabet;children;177;0;0.0392635314995563;12;8;19;10;1;29

982;1429;Effects of Birth Weight on Anti-Mullerian Hormone Serum Concentrations in Infant Girls;Context: We Previously Demonstrated That low birth weight (BW) infant girls show serum anti-Müllerian Increased hormone (AMH) Concentrations and poststimulated estradiol levels Compared to the normal-BW <U+200B><U+200B>infants, suggesting an altered follicular development. However, the impact of high BW on reproductive function is less known. Objective: To Evaluate the effect of BW on AMH, we Determined the esta Concentrations of low-BW hormone in normal-BW, and high-BW female infants 3 months During the first of life. Design: Twenty-seven low-BW, BW-29 average, and 28 high-BW Were Studied infant girls. We serum gonadotropins Measured, steroid hormones, AMH, glucose, insulin, free fatty acids, IGF-I, and adiponectin in a fasting blood sample. In Addition, in a subgroup of the normal-BW <U+200B><U+200B>(n = 23) and high-BW infants (n = 10), a GnRH analog test leuprolide acetate was performed. Results: Serum Concentrations of AMH Were higher in low-BW and BW high-to-normal infants BW Compared infants (P = 0.028 and 0.022, respectively). In Addition, in high-BW infants, adiponectin Concentrations Were lower (P = 0.018), and FSH and oestradiol levels poststimulated Were higher Compared To Normal-BW <U+200B><U+200B>infants (P = 0.024 and 0.047, respectively). Conclusions: Serum AMH and estradiol poststimulated Increased Concentrations are in low-and high-BW BW female infants, suggesting These Girls That May show evidence of an altered follicular development. However, the poststimulated Increased FSH levels and low adiponectin Concentrations Observed in high-BW infants Suggest That ovarian function is perturbed through a different mechanism from low-BW That in infants.

Polymorphisms in the CTLA-4 promoter (-318C / T) and in exon 1 (+49 A / G) Were Analyzed in 300 Patients With Chilean type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) and 310 healthy children by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. The effect of CTLA-4 allele and haplotype frequencies on the interferon-<U+03B3>, tumor necrosis factor-a, and transforming growth factor-ß1 levels in serum and the presence of GAD65 and IA-2 autoantibodies at the onset of T1D was EVALUATED. The distribution of the CTLA-4 allele and genotype frequencies was found to be in a similar Patients and control children. However, T1D Among the patients' GG genotype carriers of CTLA-4 gene on a higher frequency of anti-GAD65 autoantibodies (87.2%) was Observed. On the other hand, higher ketoacidosis at onset, age at onset younger, and higher levels of tumor necrosis factor-a and interferon-<U+03B3> Were Observed in T1D Patients carriers of G allele in comparison With the carriers of AA genotype. In conclusion, the study result of esta Showed That CTLA-4 +49 A / G and -318 C / T polymorphisms Were not linked with a higher risk for T1D genetic. However, the presence of a GG genotype or G allele dosage was associated with a younger age of onset, higher prevalence of ketoacidosis at the moment of diagnosis and positive serum anti-GAD65 autoantibodies. © 2009.;HUMAN IMMUNOLOGY;2009;Artículo;Endocrinology & metabolism;0;ctla;higher;allel;genotyp;onset;;0;0;0;12;6;19;4;20;29

The S6K1 phosphorylation induced by testosterone was blocked by rapamycin and small interfering RNA to mTOR. , Moreover, the hormone Increased Both extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK1 / 2) and protein kinase B (Akt) phosphorylation. ERK1 / 2 inhibitor PD98059 blocked the testosterone-induced S6K1 phosphorylation, Akt Whereas inhibition (Akt-inhibitor-X) HAD no effect. Testosterone-induced ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation and S6K1 blocked by Increases Were Either 1,2-bis (2-aminophenoxy) ethane-N, N, N, N-tetraacetic acid-acetoxymethylester or by inhibitors of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) pathway: U-73122 and 2-aminoethyl diphenylborate. Finally, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy was EVALUATED by, the expression of ß-myosin heavy chain, a-skeletal actin, cell size, and amino acid incorporation. Increased Testosterone all four parameters and the Increase by mTOR inhibition being blocked. Our findings Suggest That testosterone activates the mTORC1 / S6K1 axis through IP3 / Ca2 + and MEK / ERK1 / 2 to induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. © 2009 Society for Endocrinology.;JOURNAL OF ENDOCRINOLOGY;2009;Artículo;Endocrinology & metabolism;0;testosteron;induc;phosphoryl;block;erk;induc;54;14;0.0119787045252884;5;5;5;9;11;12

In This work, we made intracellular recordings of electrical activity from cells of the Within islets gerbil sand rat (fat sand rat), a model of dietary-induced T2DM. Most islet cells from lean, non-diabetic rats displayed sand glucose-induced, KATP channel-dependent, electrical oscillatory activity was similar to the That classic \bursting\"" pattern of mouse ß-cells. However, the oscillations Were slower in sand rat islets, and the dose-response curve of electrical activity versus glucose concentration was left-shifted. Of the non-bursting cells, action potentials produced some Continuously, while others displayed electrical activity That was Largely independent of glucose. The activity consisted of Latter continuous or intermittent action potential firing, and persisted for long periods in the absence of glucose. The glucose-insensitive activity was suppressed by diazoxide, indicating That the KATP channels Expressed cells. Sand rat islets intracellular Ca2 + oscillations produced reminiscent of the oscillatory electrical pattern Observed in MOST cells, albeit with a longer period.

994;2001;Estradiol increases cAMP in the oviductal secretory cells through a nongenomic mechanism;In the rat oviduct, estradiol (E2) ACCELERATES egg transport by a nongenomic action That requires previous conversion of E2 to methoxyestrogens via catechol-O-methyltranferase (COMT) and activation of estrogen receptor (ER) With subsequent production of cAMP and inositol triphosphate ( IP3). However, the role of the different oviductal cellular phenotypes E2 nongenomic on This pathway remains undetermined. The aim of study was to investigate esta the effect of E2 on the levels of cAMP and IP3 in primary cultures of secretory cells and smooth muscle from rat oviducts and determine the mechanism by Which E2 Increases cAMP in the secretory cells. In the secretory cells, E2 Increased cAMP but not IP3, while in the smooth muscle cells E2 Increased Decreased cAMP and IP3. Suppression of protein synthesis by actinomycin D did not Prevent the E2-induced cAMP Increase, but This was blocked by the ER antagonist ICI 182,780 and the inhibitors of COMT OR 486, G protein-a inhibitory (Gai) protein pertussis toxin and adenylyl cyclase (AC) SQ 22536. Expression of the mRNA for the enzymes That metabolizes estrogens, Comt, CYP1A1, and Cyp1b1 was found in the secretory cells, but not AFFECTED This was by E2.

995;2067;Insulin elicits a ROS-activated and an IP3-dependent Ca2+ release, which both impinge on GLUT4 translocation;Insulin signaling includes low levels of generation of H2O2 However, ITS origin and contribution to insulin-stimulated glucose transport are unknown. We tested the impact of H2O2 on insulin-dependent glucose transport and GLUT4 translocation in skeletal muscle cells. H2O2 the translocation of GLUT4 Increased With an exofacial Mycepitope tag Between the first and second transmembrane domains (GLUT4myc), an additive effect to That of insulin. The anti-oxidants N-acetyl L-cysteine <U+200B><U+200B>and Trolox, the p47-NOX2 NADPH oxidase inhibitory peptide gp91-ds-tat or p47phox knockdown each GLUT4myc reduced insulin-dependent translocation. Importantly, gp91-dstat suppressed insulin-dependent H2O2 production. A ryanodine receptor (RyR) channel agonist stimulated and insulin stimulated translocation GLUT4myc RyR1-mediated Ca2 + release by R and R1 S-glutathionylation Promoting. This pathway acts in parallel to insulinmediated stimulation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-(IP3) -activated Ca2 + channels, in response to activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Its downstream target phospholipase C, RESULTING in Ca2 + transfer to the mitochondria. An inhibitor of IP3 receptors, xestospongin B, reduced insulin-dependent Both IP3 production and GLUT4myc translocation. We propose That, in Addition to the canonical a, ß phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to Akt pathway, insulin Engages Both RyR-mediated Ca2 + release and IP3-receptormediated mitochondrial Ca2 + uptake, and That These signals Stimulate glucose uptake Jointly. © 2014.

996;2076;An Inositol 1,4,5-Triphosphate (IP3)-IP3 Receptor Pathway Is Required for Insulin-Stimulated Glucose Transporter 4 Translocation and Glucose Uptake in Cardiomyocytes;Intracellular calcium levels ([Ca2 +] i) and glucose uptake center are to cardiomyocyte physiology, yet connections Between them Have not Been Studied. We Investigated Whether insulin Regulates [Ca 2+] i in cultured cardiomyocytes, the participating Mechanisms, and Their influence on glucose uptake via SLC2 family of facilitative glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4). Primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes Were With the Ca2 + preloaded fluorescent dye compound fluo3-acetoxymethyl ester (AM) and Visualized by confocal microscopy. Ca2 + transport pathways targeted by selectively Were chemical and molecular inhibition. Glucose uptake was Assessed using [3H] 2-deoxyglucose, and surface GLUT4 levels in nonpermeabilized Were Quantified cardiomyocytes transfected GLUT4-myc With-enhanced green fluorescent protein. Insulin elicited a fast, two-component, transient Increase in [Ca2 +] i. Nifedipine and ryanodine preventer only the first component. The second one was reduced by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-(IP3) -receptor-selective inhibitors (xestospongin C, 2-amino ethoxydiphenylborate), by type 2 IP 3 receptor knockdown via small interfering RNA or transfected by Gß<U+03B3> peptidic inhibitor ßARKct. Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was preventer by bis (2-aminophenoxy) ethane-N, N, N ', N'-tetra-acetic acid-AM, 2-amino-ethoxydiphenylborate, and ßARK-ct or nifedipine but not by ryanodine. Similarly, insulin-dependent GLUT4 exofacial exposure of myc-enhanced green fluorescent protein was inhibited by bis (2-aminophenoxy) ethane-N, N, N ', N'-tetra-acetic acid-AM and xestospongin C but not bynifedipine. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt Were Also required for the second phase of Ca2 + release and GLUT4 translocation. Transfected dominant-negative phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase <U+03B3> inhibited the Latter. In conclusion, neonatal cardiomyocytes in primary, insulin induces an Important component of Ca2 + release via IP 3 receptor. This component signals to glucose uptake via GLUT4, revealing a so-far unrealized contribution of IP3-sensitive Ca2 + stores to insulin action. This pathway metabolism in May influence cardiac conditions yet to be explored in adult myocardium.

998;2270;Cortisol hyporesponsiveness to the low dose ACTH test is a frequent finding in a pediatric population with type 1 diabetes mellitus;Introduction: In Adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), 25% of risk of hypocortisolism has-been found through a low dose ACTH test WITH negative antibodies suggesting other causes of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction. Aim: To Evaluate adrenal function in Pediatric Patients With DM1 and correlate the results with the frequency of hypoglycemia and metabolic control. Methods: Sixty-nine Patients enrolled Were, age 12.3 (5.7-18.1) 19 girls and 50 boys. A 20% additional autoimmune diseases ADH. Mean hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was 8.1% and insulin dose was 1.14 U / kg / d. After an overnight fast, a low dose ACTH test (1 .mu.g) was performed. Basal and stimulated Concentrations cortisol, DHEAS, and plasma renin activity (PRA) Were Measured. A post-ACTH cortisol response below 18 mg / dL was abnormal considered. Results: 58% of the tested Patients Had an abnormal response to ACTH test. These Patients Present ADH lower DHEAS Concentrations, but not different in Were diabetes duration, HbA1C, severe hypoglycemia, ACTH, or PRA Concentrations Compared To Those Who had a post-ACTH cortisol standard. One patient out of 59, had a positive anti-21-hydroxylase antibody (21OHA) and presented a poor response to ACTH. Conclusions: We found a significant proportion of our Patients Having a subnormal cortisol response independent of the presence of anti-adrenal cell antibodies. We did not find a correlation With metabolic control probably due to the good metabolic monitoring of this group. The absence of 21OHA does not rule out subclinical hypocortisolism In This population.

999;2278;MicroRNAs miR-21a and miR-93 are down regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with type 1 diabetes;Introduction: It is well established that type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease. Controversial data exists Regarding the differential monitoring of the immune system in T1D Patients Compared to unaffected Individuals. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are Involved in the Control of gene expression (by negative regulation of gene expression at post-transcriptional level, by mediating degradation or translational repression of the mRNA targets). Their potential role in T cell activation and autoimmunity is controversial. Aim: We Investigated the expression profile of miR-21A and miR-93 in samples of 20 T1D PMC Patients and 20 healthy controls by Means of qPCR in different glucose Concentrations (basal, 11 nM and 25 mM), and we Analyzed the possible relationship of esta expression pattern with autoimmunity. Results: miR-21A was underexpressed in T1D Significantly samples (mean values <U+200B><U+200B>± 0.05 0.23 expression, p <0.01) Compared to controls (values <U+200B><U+200B>less than one Indicate a decrease in gene expression). When the PMCs Were incubated With mM glucose and 25 mM 11, miR-21A expression in controls and Decreased Increased in T1D samples (0.506 ± 0.05, p <0.04). MiR-93 was underexpressed in T1D Patients (0.331 ± 0.05, p <0.02) Compared To samples control. However, When the PBMCs incubated With glucose Were not Were Observed changes. No association with autoimmunity was Observed. Conclusion: We Demonstrated That miRNAs have a differential expression in PBMCs from T1D Patients Compared to controls, suggesting These miRNAs or others That Could Be Involved in T cell regulation. © 2012 Elsevier GmbH.;IMMUNOBIOLOGY;2013;Artículo;Endocrinology & metabolism;0;mir;autoimmun;compar;sampl;gene;gene;102;6;0.0226264418811003;12;6;12;8;3;29
1000;2349;PD-L1 gene polymorphisms and low serum level of PD-L1 protein are associated to type 1 diabetes in Chile;Introduction: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) has a complex etiology in Which genetic and environmental factors are Involved, not yet Whose interactions Have Been completely clarified. In This context, the role in PD-1 pathway and Its ligands 1 and 2 (PD-L1 and PD-L2) Have Been Proposed as candidates in autoimmune diseases Several. The aim of This work was to determine the allele and haplotype frequency of six gene polymorphisms of PD-ligands (PD-L1 and PD-L2) in Chilean T1D Patients and Their effect on serum levels of PD-L1 and autoantibody profile (GAD65 and IA2). Methods: This study cohort Comprised 205 and 205 T1D Patients Normal children. We performed genotypic analysis of PD-L1 and PD-L2 genes by TaqMan method. Determination of anti-GAD65 and anti-IA-2 autoantibodies was performed by ELISA. The PD-L1 serum levels Were Measured. Results: The distribution of allelic variants PD-L1 (rs2297137 rs4143815 and) Showed Differences Between T1D Patients and controls (p = 0.035 and p = 0.022, respectively). Differences Were not detected Among the PD-L2 polymorphisms, and only the rs16923189 Showed genetic variation. Patients T1D Showed Decreased serum levels of PD-L1 Compared To controls: 1.42 [0.23-7.45] ng / mL versus 3.35 [0.49-5.89] ng / mL (p <0.025). In Addition, the CGG haplotype in PD-L1 associated With T1D (constructed from rs822342, rs2297137 and rs4143815 polymorphisms) Showed an OR = 1.44 [1.08 to 1.93]. Finally, no association of genetic variants These serum was Observed With Concentrations of PD ligands or auto-antibody profile,, Although a Correlation between PD-L1 ligand serum concentration and the age at disease onset was detected. Conclusion: Two polymorphism of PD-L1 are presented in different allelic variants Between T1D and healthy subjects, Present PDL-1 serum levels are lowered in Significantly diabetics patients. , Moreover, the age of onset of the disease determine Differences Between ligand serum levels in diabetics, being lower in younger. These results points to a possible establishment of PDL-1 as a marker for genetic and biochemical T1D onset, at Least in Chilean population. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.;DIABETES-METABOLISM RESEARCH AND REVIEWS;2014;Artículo;Endocrinology & metabolism;0;serum;ligand;genet;polymorph;show;;0;0;0;12;6;19;4;20;29

We Studied five Individuals with KCS and five With OCS and found all of them HAD That heterozygous mutations in FAM111A. One mutation was Identified in four unrelated Individuals with KCS, and another one was Identified in two unrelated Individuals with OCS all occurred de novo. THUS, OCS and KCS are allelic disorders of different severity. FAM111A codes for 611 amino acid protein with homology to trypsin With-like peptidases. , Although FAM111A has-been found to bind to the large T-antigen of SV40 viral replication and restrict, ITS native function is unknown. Molecular modeling of FAM111A shows That waste Affected by KCS and OCS mutations do not map close to the active site but are clustered on a segment of the protein and are at, or close to, ITS outer surface, suggesting That the Pathogenesis Involves the interaction With as yet unidentified proteins partner rather than impaired catalysis.

1002;2648;Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2;Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2) is an autosomal dominant cancer syndrome with Major medullary thyroid carcinoma components of (MTC), pheochromocytoma and hyperparathyroidism. The disease is Caused by germline mutations of the RET proto-oncogene. Subtypes of MEN 2 include MEN 2A, 2B and familial MTC MEN (MCTF) Which differ in pattern of additional lesions or - in MCTF - lack of pheochromocytoma. In 2009, after extensive review of the literature, the guidelines of the American Thyroid Association made Several Recommendations Regarding clinical and genetic diagnostic testing and treatment options. In this article, the recently published literature is reviewed and Concerns Regarding future perspectives are added. In particularly, a critical handling of rare DNA variants and double mutations is Necessary. Up to now, mutation-specific risk profiles and mutation-associated treatment Recommendations are unavailable.

1003;2673;Excess Iodide Induces an Acute Inhibition of the Sodium/Iodide Symporter in Thyroid Male Rat Cells by Increasing Reactive Oxygen Species;Na + / I- symporter (NIS) Mediates iodide (I-) uptake in the thyroid gland, the first and rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of the thyroid hormones. The expression and function of NIS in thyroid cells is mainly regulated by TSH and by the intracellular concentration of I-. High doses of I- for 1 or 2 days inhibit the synthesis of thyroid hormones, a process Known as the Wolff-Chaikoff effect. The Cellular Mechanisms responsible for esta physiological response are mediated in part by the inhibition of I- uptake through a reduction of NIS expression. Here we show inhibition of I- That OCCURS uptake as early as 2 hours or 5 hours after exposure to excess I- in FRTL-5 cells and the rat thyroid gland, respectively. Inhibition of I- uptake was not due to reduced or altered localization NIS expression in thyroid cells. We Observed That incubation of FRTL-5 cells for 2 With excess I- hours Increased H <inf> 2 </ inf> O <inf> 2 </ inf> generation. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of excess I- I- on NIS-mediated transport Could Be recapitulated by H <inf> 2 </ inf> O <inf> 2 </ inf> and reverted by reactive oxygen species derived scavengers. The data shown here support the notion That Inhibits excess I- NIS at the cell surface at early times by Means of a posttranslational mechanism That Involves derived reactive oxygen species.

1004;2729;Permanent Neonatal Diabetes and Enteric Anendocrinosis Associated With Biallelic Mutations in NEUROG3;OBJECTIVE - NEUROG3 plays the central role in the development of pancreatic islets and enteroendocrine Both cells. Homozygous missense mutations in NEUROG3 hypomorphic Have Been recently associated with a rare form of congenital malabsorptive diarrhea secondary to enteroendocrine cell dysgenesis. Interestingly, the Patients did not Develop neonatal diabetes but childhood-onset diabetes. We hypothesized That Might null mutations in NEUROG3 be responsible for the disease in a patient With permanent neonatal diabetes and severe congenital malabsorptive diarrhea. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - The single coding exon of NEUROG3 was amplified from genomic DNA and sequenced. The mutant protein isoforms Characterized by measuring Were functionally Their ability to bind to an E-box element in the NEUROD1 promoter in vitro and to induce ectopic endocrine cell formation and cell delamination after in ovo electroporation chicken endoderm. RESULTS - Two different point mutations in heterozygous NEUROG3 Were Identified in the proband [c.82> .T (p.E28X) and c.404T> C (p.L135P)], each being inherited from an unaffected parent. Both in vitro and in vivo functional studies Indicated That the mutant isoforms are biologically inactive. In keeping With This not enteroendocrine cells Were detected in intestinal biopsy samples from the patient. CONCLUSIONS - Severe deficiency of neurogenin 3 causes a novel rare subtype of permanent neonatal diabetes. This finding confirms the essential role of NEUROG3 in islet development and function in humans. © 2011 by the American Diabetes Association.;DIABETES;2011;Artículo;Endocrinology & metabolism;0;neurog;diabet;develop;enteroendocrin;function;develop;57;13;0.0126441881100266;12;6;19;8;18;9
1005;2738;Comparison of three doses of leuprolide acetate in the treatment of central precocious puberty: preliminary results;Objective Depot luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist Have Been Widely used for the treatment of the central precocious puberty (CPP), but the optimal doses to Obtain hormonal suppression are still unknown, especially in Patients With higher weights. The goal of our study was to compare the efficacy of three leuprolide acetate (LA) preparations, suppressing gonadotropin secretion in Patients With CPP. Design In an open protocol 12-month, we EVALUATED LA 7 · 5 mg / month, 11 · 25 and 22 · 5 every 3 months. Patients Fourteen girls with CPP and weights over 30 kg. Measurements: Clinical, radiological and laboratory follow-up: GnRH test plus LH, FSH was 40 min post analogue Periodically performed. Results Pretreatment basal and stimulated LH levels LHRH Between groups Were not different. Basal and stimulated LH LHRH Decreased levels Significantly Between baseline and from 3 up to 12 months of therapy in all groups (P = 0 · 001). GnRH stimulated LH peak <2 IU / l, the main efficacy criterion was met in 80, 75 and 100% of the children at 6 months in the 7 · 5, 11 · 25, 22 · 5 mg doses respectively. By 12 months, 100% of Patients suppressed to ADH LH <2 IU / l. Conclusions These results affirm That 3-month injections May be a satisfactory alternative for the therapy of Children with CPP to avoid monthly injections. In Addition, suppression of LH OCCURS sooner in the 3-month 22 · 5 mg DOSE Compared to the 3-month 11 · 5 mg THEREFORE, adequate dosing May be Important for optimal outcome.

1006;2739;Elevated anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) and inhibin B levels in prepubertal girls with type 1 diabetes mellitus;Elevated anti-Müllerian Objective hormone (AMH) and adrenal androgen levels Have Been Observed During childhood in girls at risk of developing Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS). The aim was to study de este evaluate- ovarian function and adrenal steroid levels in prepubertal girls with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D). Design Cross-sectional study. Patients / Measurements We EVALUATED hormonal and ultrasonographic Characteristics in girls with T1D (n = 73) and Compared to them Characteristics found in a group of healthy girls (N = 86) control. Data are reported almost as geometric Means (95% CI). Results Prepubertal girls with T1D ADH higher levels of AMH (29 · 1 pmol / l (23 · 2-36 · 3) vs 20 · 9 pmol / l (16 · 6-26 · 1), P = 0 · 038), inhibin B (arithmetic mean: 16 · 7 pg / ml (11 · 6-21 · 7) vs 11 · 7 pg / ml (10 · 0-13 · 5), P = 0 · 044) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS) (0 · 3 nmol / l (0 · 2-0 · 6) vs 0 · 2 nmol / l (0 · 1-0 · 3)) than controls (P = 0 · 045). During puberty, decreasing AMH levels in girls with Were Observed T1D only (P <0 · 0001). Girls with T1D in Tanner stages 4-5 ADH lower AMH levels than healthy controls Their paired (10 · 1 pmol / l (7 · 4-13 · 9) vs 15 · 7 pmol / l (11 · 6-21 · 3) , respectively, P = 0 · 047). Conclusions Our observations Indicate That prepubertal girls with T1D May exhibit endocrine Similar to Those findings of other girls at risk of developing PCOS. The elevated levels of AMH and inhibin B Suggest That higher numbers of follicles are present in the ovary During childhood in These Patients and insulin treatment That May act as a local growth factor. In Addition, AMH levels prepubertal and pubertal differed in girls, suggesting the effect of T1D That on ovarian folliculogenesis gonadotrophin levels rise eleven changes During puberty. © 2 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.;CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY;2011;Artículo;Endocrinology & metabolism;0;girl;amh;pmol;prepubert;observ;;0;0;0;10;3;10;3;15;30
1007;2740;High sodium intake is associated with increased glucocorticoid production, insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome;Objective High sodium (HS) diet is associated With hypertension (HT) and insulin resistance (IR). We EVALUATED Whether HS diet was associated with a dysregulation of cortisol production and metabolic syndrome (MetS). Patients and measurements We Recruited 370 adults (18-85 years, BMI 29 ± 4 · 3 · 4 kg / m2, 70% women, 72% HT, 61% MetS). HS diet (urinary sodium & gt 150 mEq / day) was 70% of Observed in subjects. We Measured plasma hormones, lipid profile, urinary free cortisol (UFC) and cortisol tetrahydrometabolites (THM). Results Urinary sodium was correlated With UFC (r = + 0 · 45, P & lt 0 · 001), cortisol THM (r = + 0 · 41, P & lt 0 · 001) and inversely With adiponectin, HDL and aldosterone, after adjusting by age, gender and BMI. Subjects With high, Compared With adequate sodium intake (50-149 mEq / day) ADH higher CFUs (P & lt 0 · 001), THM (P & lt 0 · 001), HOMA-IR (P = 0 · 04), HT (81% vs 50%, P & lt 0 · 001), mets (69% vs 41%, P & lt 0 · 001) and lower adiponectin (P = 0 · 003). A multivariate predictive model adjusted by confounders Showed a high discriminative capacity for MetS (ROC curve 0 · 878) using four clinical variables: intake HS [OR = 5 · 6 (2 · 3-15 · CI 3)], HOMA-IR [ OR 1 · 7 (1 · 3-2 · 2)] cortisol THM [OR 1 · 2 (1 · 1-1 · 4)] and adiponectin [OR = 0 · 9 (0 · 0 · 9 8-)], the Latter had a protective effect. Conclusions High sodium diet was associated With cortisol and Its Increased urinary metabolites.

1014;3244;Testosterone Modulates the Expression of Molecules Linked to Insulin Action and Glucose Uptake in Endometrial Cells;Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common disorder associated With hyperandrogenic insulin resistance. Insulin exerts ITS metabolic function by activating the PI3K / Akt pathway and Favoring glucose uptake. Caveolin-1 is a scaffolding protein Which Increases insulin receptor (IR) stability. Alternatively, activation of IR Increases caveolin-1 phosphorylation on tyrosine-14. Furthermore, endometrial tissue from Patients PCOS is insulin resistant Proposed to be however, the special role of testosterone in modulating the metabolic effects of insulin in endometrial stromal remains unexplored cells. To evaluate- Whether androgens modulate the response to insulin, hESCs T-cells stimulated with 100 nM Were testosterone for 24 h and changes in the protein levels of caveolin-1, IR, Akt and Were Determined by Western blotting (WB). After testosterone treatment, the Consequences of acute insulin stimulation Were EVALUATED by WB analysis of phospho-S473Akt and phospho-Y14Caveolin-1, as well as by measuring glucose 2-deoxyglucose incorporation analyzing (2-DOG) uptake.

1015;3245;Changes in the Expression of Insulin Signaling Pathway Molecules in Endometria from Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Women with or without Hyperinsulinemia;Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine-metabolic disorder associated With compensatory hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. Scarce information is available on the expression of molecules in the insulin pathway Involved in Endometrial from Women with PCOS. THEREFORE, we Examined the protein levels of insulin-signaling molecules, like insulin receptor, insulin-receptor substrate (IRS) -1, PIRS-1Y612, Akt, AS160, pAS160T642 and GLUT4 from endometria in PCOS women With or Without hyperinsulinemia. Protein levels Were Assessed by Western blot and immunohistochemistry in 21-proliferative endometria phase from women Control (EC = 7), PCOS women normoinssulinemic (PCOSE-NI = 7) and hyperinsulinemic PCOS women (PCOSE-HI = 7). The data show no Differences in the expression of insulin receptor Between all groups as Assessed by Western blot however, IRS-1 and PIRS-1Y612 Were lower than in PCOSE-HI controls and PCOSE-NI (P <0.05). AS160 was detected in all tissues Analyzed With a similar expression levels Between groups. Importantly, PCOSE-HI exhibited lower levels of pAS160T642 (P <0.05) and of GLUT4 (P <0.05) Compared With CE. The immunohistochemistry for insulin receptor, IRS-1, Akt, AS160 and GLUT4 Showed epithelial and stromal localization IRS-1 staining was lower in PCOSE-HI (P <0.05). In conclusion, human endometrium have the machinery for glucose uptake mediated by insulin. The diminished expression of GLUT4, as well as the lower level of Pirs-1Y612 and pAS160T642 Exhibited by PCOSE-HI, Suggests a disruption in the translocation of GLUT4 vesicles to the cell With surface in These patients. © 2 The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research.;MOLECULAR MEDICINE;2010;Artículo;Endocrinology & metabolism;0;insulin;pcose;glut;pcos;women;women;64;10;0.0141969831410825;10;3;1;3;16;30

NEVERTHELESS, few studies addressed the impact Have prenatal exposure to an excess of androgens on reproductive and of metabolic functions in evils. The aim of the present study was to ASSESS the impact of prenatal exposure to an excess of testosterone or dihydrotestosterone on the luteinizing hormone (LH) Characteristics press in male sexual development During sheep. Control male sheep (C-males) and males born to mothers exposed to twice weekly injections of 30 mg testosterone or dihydrotestosterone from day 30-90 and 40 mg from day 90 to 120 of gestation (T-males, DHT-males) Were Studied at 5, 10, and 20 weeks of age, ages That Represent infancy, early prepubertal, and late stages of sexual development prepubertal in This species, respectively. Patterns of LH pulsatility Showed That T and DHT-males exhibited higher secretion of LH to the 6-h During study and a higher amplitude of the LH pulses Compared with C-males. , Moreover, nadir of the pulses was higher in T and DHT-males Compared with C-males. Frequency of LH pulses, however, was not different ages or Between Within groups. These results show That evils can be responsive to androgenization and suggest prenatal treatment transiently That alters the amplitude of LH pulses probably the result of defects as in the pituitary responsiveness pattern or in the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release pattern. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart New York.;HORMONE AND METABOLIC RESEARCH;2012;Artículo;Endocrinology & metabolism;0;male;prenat;puls;age;dht;age;151;2;0.0334960070984916;4;6;4;3;15;30

Pituitary and testicular responsiveness was tested by Administering a GnRH analog (leuprolide acetate). To complement the analyzes, the mRNA expression of LH receptor (LHR) and That of steroidogenic enzymes in testicular tissue Were Determined. Basal LH and testosterone Concentrations Were higher in the testosterone-exposed-males. While LH response to GnRH analog was the higher in the testosterone-exposed than in the evils evils control did not differ testosterone responses Between the treatment groups. The testosterone: LH ratio was higher than in the Control evils in the testosterone-exposed evils of 30 weeks of age, suggestive of reduced sensitivity to Leydig cell LH in the testosterone-exposed evils. The expression of LHR mRNAwas lower in the testosterone-exposed evils, but the mRNA expression of steroidogenic enzymes did not differ Between the groups.

The lower incidence of mammary cancer in Asian women than in Western women Has Been Attributed to high intake of soy isoflavones, genistein Including. Our previous work in the prepubertal rat uterus model Showed That genistein (0.5 mg / kg body weight subcutaneously) Caused an estradiol-like myometrial hypertrophy in luminal epithelial cells and uterine and an Increase in RNA content in luminal epithelium however, it did not induce cell proliferation, uterine eosinophilia, endometrial or edema. The present study Investigated, in the same Animal model, the effect of genistein administration (0.5 mg / kg body weight subcutaneously) before treatment With estradiol-17ß (0.33 mg / kg body weight subcutaneously) on uterine responses That Were not induced by genistein. Pretreatment With This phytoestrogen completely inhibited estradiol-induced uterine luminal epithelium in mitoses, endometrial stroma, and myometrium and partially inhibited estradiol-induced uterine eosinophilia and endometrial edema. These findings Indicate That genistein Protects against estrogen-induced cell proliferation in the uterus and suggest That Should future studies investigate the Possibility of using esta agent to decrease the risk for uterine cancer after climacteric hormone replacement therapy in women. © 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. and Korean Society of Food Science and Nutrition.;JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL FOOD;2011;Artículo;Endocrinology & metabolism;0;induc;uterin;genistein;estradiol;women;women;64;10;0.0141969831410825;1;5;1;2;16;40

We show here the osteogenic transcription factor That Runx2 gene controls Involved in sterol / steroid metabolism, treats including CYP11A1, Cyp39a1, CYP51, LSS, and Dhcr7 in Murine osteoprogenitor cells. CYP11A1 (P450scc) encodes an approximately 55-kDa mitochondrial enzyme catalyzes That side-chain cleavage of cholesterol and is rate limiting for steroid hormone biosynthesis. Runx2 is coexpressed With CYP11A1 in osteoblasts as well as nonosseous cell types (e.g. testis and breast cancer cells), suggesting a role for broad biological Runx2 in sterol / steroid metabolism. Notably, osteoblasts and breast cancer cells express an approximately 32-kDa truncated isoform of CYP11A1 That is nonmitochondrial and localized in the cytoplasm Both and the nucleus. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyzes and gel shift assays show That Runx2 binds to the CYP11A1 gene promoter in osteoblasts, indicating CYP11A1 That is a direct target of Runx2.

1021;3684;Metformin augments the levels of molecules that regulate the expression of the insulin-dependent glucose transporter GLUT4 in the endometria of hyperinsulinemic PCOS patients;STUDY QUESTIONDoes treatment With the insulin sensitizer metformin modify the levels and activation of proteins related to the expression of the insulin-dependent glucose transporter (GLUT4), Such as adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and myocyte enhancer 2A factor (MEF2A) in endometrial from hyperinsulinemic hyperandrogenemic polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS h-Ins) Patients? SUMMARY answerin PCOS h-Ins Patients, metformin endometrial Increases levels of GLUT4 mRNA and protein levels by normalizing the quantity and activation of molecules That Regulate GLUT4 expression to healthy values. These changes could improve endometrial metabolic function.WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWNPCOS is an endocrine-metabolic disorders closely associated With insulin resistance. In particular the insulin signaling pathway is impaired in Endometrial From These Patients and the concentration of GLUT4, as well as the molecules Involved in Its translocation to the cell surface, is Decreased. However, there are limited data About the Mechanisms That Regulate the GLUT4 expression in the Endometrial and the effect of metformin on them.STUDY DESIGN, SIZE AND DURATIONThis is a case-control study in the setting of a research unit, approved by the Ethical Committees of our institution. The groups Whose Endometrial Were Studied Were PCOS h-Ins (n <U+200B><U+200B>= 8) PCOS Patients With hyperandrogenemia hyperinsulinemia taking only metformin for at Least 3 months (PCOS-MTF, n = 8) and healthy fertile women at the time of hysterectomy Because of benign pathology as controls (EC, n = 8) .PARTICIPANTS / MATERIALS, SETTING , METHODSSteroids and sex hormone-binding globulin Were Measured and glucose and insulin levels Were EVALUATED During an oral glucose tolerance test. Protein levels for aAMPK (catalytic subunit of AMPK), phosphorylated (p) -AMPKaThr172 (activating phosphorylation site), MEF2A, p-MEF2AThr312 (activating phosphorylation site) and GLUT4 Were Assessed by western blot and immunohistochemistry. In Addition, GLUT4 gene expression by RT-EVALUATED was PCR.MAIN RESULTS AND ROLE OF THE CHANCEWe found Significantly lower levels of MEF2A and p-MEF2AThr312 in PCOS h-Ins Compared With endometria CE (P & lt 0.05). Also, we detected lower levels of p- AMPKaThr172 in PCOS h-Ins endometria Compared With the PCOS-MTF group (P & lt 0.05). The ratios of phospho-AMPK / total AMPK and phospho-MEF2A / total MEF2A Were Significantly Increased in the PCOS-MTF Compared With the h-Ins PCOS group (P & lt 0.05). The RT-PCR experiments Showed lower levels of GLUT4 mRNA transcripts in PCOS h-Ins Compared With PCOS-MTF-treated group (P & lt 0.05), the protein levels of GLUT4 Were Decreased in a like way.LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTIONThe limited Number of Patients included in this study presented large clinical variability WHO. THEREFORE, it would be Necessary to recruit a greater number of Patients to minimize our data in order to prove scatter the clinical benefits of metformin Described by others.WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGSSince the insulin sensitizer metformin Increases the expression of the GLUT4, It May Improve endometrial physiology in PCOS Patients and, Therefore, better reproductive outcomes Promote. These results Suggest That in PCOS Patients, metformin May act at the endometrial level Directly and decrease insulin resistance condition by the expression of GLUT4 increase increasing and, in This Way, endometrial Indirectly restore function.STUDY FUNDING / Competing INTEREST (S) This work was supported by National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development (grant number 1095127 to MV).

1022;3694;Potential role of skeletal muscle glucose metabolism on the regulation of insulin secretion;Summary: Pancreatic beta cells sense and release glucose flux as much insulin as required in order to Maintain glycaemia Within a narrow range. Insulin secretion is regulated by many factors Including glucose, incretins, sympathetic and parasympathetic tones and other physiological factors Among. To Identify the Mechanisms linking obesity-related insulin resistance impaired insulin secretion Represents With central challenge. Recently, it has-been to crosstalk Between Argued That skeletal muscle and the pancreas May Regulate insulin secretion. Considering That skeletal muscle is the largest organ in non-obese subjects and a major site of insulin- and exercise-stimulated glucose disposal, it Appears That muscle Might plausible Interact with the pancreas and insulin secretion for Appropriate modulate intracellular peripheral glucose utilization. There is growing evidence That muscle can secrete so-called myokines That Can Have auto / to / endocrine actions. , Although it is unclear direction in Which They act, interleukin-6 Seems to be a possible candidate muscle-derived protein mediating inter-organ Such communication. We review some of the HEREIN putative skeletal muscle-derived factors mediating esta interaction.

1023;3730;A Circadian Clock Entrained by Melatonin Is Ticking in the Rat Fetal Adrenal;The adrenal gland in the adult is a peripheral circadian clock in the coordination of Involved energy intake and expenditure, required for adaptation to the external environment. During fetal life, to circadian clock is present peripheral in the nonhuman primate adrenal gland. Whether esta extends the fetal adrenal gland to like the rat is unknown. Here we explored in vivo and in vitro Whether the rat fetal adrenal circadian clock is a peripheral entrained by melatonin. We Measured the 24-h changes in adrenal content of corticosterone and in the expression of clock genes Per-2 and Bmal-1 and of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), MT1 melatonin receptor, and early growth response protein 1 (Egr-1 ) expression. In culture, we explored oscillatory Whether expression of These genes persisted During 48 h and the effect of a 4-h melatonin press on Their expression. In vivo, the rat adrenal gland Showed fetal circadian expression of Bmal-1 and Peru-2 in antiphase (acrophases at 2200 and 1300 h, respectively) as well as of MT1 and Egr-1. This was Accompanied by corticosterone content of circadian rhythms and expression of StAR peaking at 0600 h Both. The 24-h oscillatory expression of Bmal-1, Per-2, StAR, Mt1, and Egr-1 persisted During 48 hours in culture however, the antiphase Between Per-2 and Bmal-1 was lost. The press of melatonin shifted the acrophases of all the genes Studied and restored the antiphase Between Per-2 and Bmal-1. THUS, in the rat, the fetal adrenal peripheral clock is a strong Potentially amenable to regulation by maternal melatonin.

1025;3770;Prevalence of metabolic syndrome and associated factors in women aged 35 to 65 years who were enrolled in a family health program in Brazil;The Aims of esta study to estimate the prevalence Were of metabolic syndrome Among women aged 35 to 65 years and to identify identity associated factors. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study. We randomly selected 581 women (aged 35-65 y) from enrolled in a Those Among family health program in the city of Pindamonhangaba, Brazil. Metabolic syndrome was Identified in Accordance With the definition of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III. Health conditions and lifestyle habits Were EVALUATED by a survey, and anthropometric measurements Were Obtained. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was Estimated, and Poisson regression was used to Evaluate the associations Between metabolic syndrome 'and the factors Investigated. RESULTS: The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 42.2% (95% CI 38.1-46.2). The most common metabolic syndrome component was abdominal obesity (60.6%), followed by low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (51.3%), high levels of triglycerides (41.4%), high blood pressure (31.7%), and diabetes (9/13 %). The following factors associated Were With metabolic syndrome: the 45- to 54-year age group (prevalence ratio, 1.54 95% CI, 1.08-2.01), the 55- to 65-year age group (prevalence ratio, 3.51 95% CI, 1.49-3.10), hyperuricemia (prevalence ratio, 2.95 95% CI, 1.15-1.86), and sleep apnea risk (prevalence ratio, 2.41 95% CI, 1.16-1.82). We found an inverse association Between metabolic syndrome and Having more than 5 years ADH of schooling (prevalence ratio, 0.65 95% CI, 0.65-1.04). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of metabolic syndrome is high, and the associated clinical factors are hyperuricemia and risk of sleep apnea. © 2012 by The North American Menopause Society.;MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY;2013;Artículo;Endocrinology & metabolism;0;metabol;preval;syndrom;ratio;age;age;151;2;0.0334960070984916;15;3;16;3;21;45

1027;4021;TACE/ADAM17 is involved in germ cell apoptosis during rat spermatogenesis;The pathways leading to male germ cell apoptosis in vivo are poorly Understood, but are highly Relevant for the comprehension of sperm production by the testis regulation. In This work, we show the evidence of a mechanism Where germ cell apoptosis is induced through the inactivation and shedding of the extracellular domain of KIT (c-kit) by the protease TACE / a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17) During the first wave of spermatogenesis in the rat. We show That germ cells apoptosis Undergoing Lacked the extracellular domain of the KIT receptor. TACE / ADAM17, a membrane-bound metalloprotease, was highly Expressed in germ cells Undergoing Apoptosis as well. On the Contrary, cell surface presence of ADAM10, metalloprotease to closely related isoform, was not associated With apoptotic germ cells. Pharmacological inhibition of TACE / ADAM17, but not ADAM10, germ cell apoptosis Significantly preventer in the pubertal male rat. Induction of TACE / ADAM17 by the phorbol ester phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) induced germ cell apoptosis, Which was preventer email when an inhibitor of TACE / ADAM17 was present in the assay. Ex-vivo rat testis culture Showed That the PMA induced cleavage of the extracellular domain KIT. Isolation of apoptotic germ cells Showed That even though protein levels of TACE / ADAM17 Were higher in apoptotic cells than in nonapoptotic germ cells, the Contrary was Observed for ADAM10. These results Suggest That TACE / ADAM17 is one of the elements triggering physiological germ cell apoptosis During the first wave of spermatogenesis. © 2 Society for Reproduction and Fertility.;REPRODUCTION;2010;Artículo;Endocrinology & metabolism;0;adam;germ;apoptosi;tace;kit;;0;0;0;5;5;5;8;16;10
1028;4063;Reproducibility and performance of one or two samples of salivary cortisol in the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome using an automated immunoassay system;The purpose of this article is to Evaluate the variability and reproducibility of late night salivary cortisol (LNSC) using electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) and compare the accuracy of one or two samples in diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome (CS). We prospectively included 64 healthy volunteers (HV), 35 Patients With clinically suspected CS (S), and 26 Patients With CS confirmed. Nine Patients in the group CS 24-h urinary ADH free cortisol (UFC) less than two times the upper limit of the normal (mild CS). UFC and two consecutive LNSC (LNSC1, LNSC2) Were Collected at home. All Patients in the group S and CFU standard ADH low-dose dexamethasone suppression test. Were not found Differences Between the HV and S groups in UFC LNSC1, and LNSC2. Intraindividual variability Between the two samples was 22% of LNSC in HV (1.6-91%), 32% in the S group (1.6-144%), and 51% (1.6-156%) in the CS group. Variability was higher than in CS Patients Those in the HV (P <0.001) and S groups (P = 0.05).

1030;4285;Cryptochrome 2 Expression Level Is Critical for Adrenocorticotropin Stimulation of Cortisol Production in the Capuchin Monkey Adrenal;Timely production of glucocorticoid hormones in response to ACTH is essential for survival by coordinating energy intake and expenditure and acting as homeostatic regulators against stress. Adrenal cortisol response to ACTH clock is time dependent, suggesting an intrinsic circadian oscillator That in the adrenal cortex Contributes to modulate the response to ACTH. Circadian clock gene expression in the adrenal cortex hasbeenreported of Several Species. However, there arenoreports accounting for potential Involvement of adrenal clock proteins cortisol response to ACTH on. Here we explored Whether the clock cryptochrome protein 2 (CRY2) knockdown modifies the adrenal response to ACTH in a primate. Adrenal gland explants from adult capuchin monkey (n = 5) Were preincubated for 6 h With transfection vehicle (control) or with two different Cry2 antisense and sense probes followed by 48 h incubation in medium alone (not ACTH) or with 100 nM ACTH. Under control and sense conditions, cortisol ACTH Increased production, inhibited ACTH suppression Whereas CRY2-stimulated cortisol production. Expression of the steroidogenic enzymes steroidogenic acute regulatory protein-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 3'at 48 h of incubation was Increased by ACTH in explants and suppressed by Cry2 knockdown control. Additionally, we found Cry2 That knockdown Decreased expression of the clock the brain and muscle gene aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like protein (Bmal1) at themRNA and protein levels. These results strongly support altogether the clock protein CRY2 That is Involved in the mechanism by Which Increases the expression of ACTH steroidogenic acute regulatory protein-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 3'. THUS, adequate expression levels of components of the circadian clock adrenal are required for an cortisol response to ACTH Appropriate.

The AUC of the ROC curve to ASSESS the ability of esta molecule to discriminate Between active vs inactive UC was 0.92 (0.86-0.97, P <0.0001). The serum levels of sST2 In Patients With UC Significantly Correlated With endoscopic and histo-pathological scores (r = 0.76 and r = 0.67, P <0.0001, respectively), and With the pro-inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-a (r = 0.69 and r = 0.61, respectively, P <0.0001). Interestingly, we found a direct Correlation between whole intestinal ST2 content and serum levels of sST2, adjusted to endoscopic activity score in Patients With mild (r = 0.44, P = 0.004), moderate (r = 0.59, P = 0.002) and severe disease (r = 0.82, P = 0.002). Only Patients With UC inactive Showed no significant correlation (r = 0.45, P = 0.267). CONCLUSION: With sST2 levels correlated disease severity and inflammatory cytokines, are able to differentiate active from inactive UC and Might have a role as a biomarker. © 2011 Baishideng.

924;190;Changes in iron transporter divalent metal transporter 1 in proximal jejunum after gastric bypass;AIM: To describe the variation That divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) shows in Patients after gastric bypass Rouxen- Y (RYGB) surgery. METHODS: Prospective and analytical study of T1DM level at the brush border of proximal jejunum in Patients Having undergone RYGB surgery. The mucosa of proximal jejunum anastomosis forming the gastrojejunal was biopsied During surgery and after 6 mo Later with an endoscopic biopsy. Patients received all the instructions required feeding and nutritional supplementation Regarding. Both samples processed at the same Were time by immunohistochemistry and western blot. Samples Were analysed by a pathologist. For statistical analysis, the <U+03C7> 2 and Wilcoxon tests Were used. RESULTS: Sixteen Patients Were Recruited, 13 of Whom the study completed. Were Twelve women. Average age and body mass index (BMI) 44.1 and 40.4 Were, respectively. Both body weight and BMI Significantly Decreased During the study period, with an average excess weight loss percent (% EWL) of 60% ± 13.3% and an average BMI percent excess loss (% EBMIL) of 79.6% ± 21.6%. Only two presented Patients With Mild anemia 6 m after surgery, but ferritin levels stayed Within Their standard ranges. Staining for DMT1 Showed a significant Increase in the cytoplasm of enterocytes located at the tips of the villi (<U+03C7> 2 = 6.03 p = 0.049). NEVERTHELESS, the overall quantity of T1DM Decreased Significantly (Z = 2.04 p = 0.04). Associated With These results, we Observed Increase in a significant goblet cells in the villi 6 mo postoperatively (Z = -2.47, p = 0.). CONCLUSION: Six months after RYGB surgery, Patients exhibit an Increase in T1DM expression in the enterocytes of the tips of the villi at the proximal jejunum. © 2014 Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

925;255;Diversity of Hepatitis B and C Viruses in Chile;, Although there is a low prevalence rate (around 1% of the population) of hepatitis B virus infection With (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) in Chile, little is Known About the molecular diversity and Characteristics of the circulating viruses. In the present study, 40 HBV and 57 HCV samples from Santiago City, Chile, Were Examined. The phylogenetic analysis of HBV samples Showed the autochthonous genotype F as the MOST Represented genotype in the study (67.5%), while genotypes A, B, C, and D Were less frequent (7.5%, 5%, 7.5%, and 12.5% , respectively). The frequency of circulation of HBV genotypes in Accordance With Observed is the genetic background of the Chilean population. Most of the samples tested HCV subtype 1b Belonged to (82%). The coalescent analysis Conducted for NS5A and NS5B Both the regions of the HCV strains Showed like population growth rates, with a common ancestor Most recent Estimated to date Between 1893 and 1901. This result May Indicate That genotype 1b strains circulating in Chile Have a similar epidemiological features Those to HCV genotype 1b for Described in Brazil and the United States. However, the recent common ancestor for MOST Chile is older than That for genotype 1b Reported recently in Argentina. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.;JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY;2009;Artículo;Gastroenterology & hepatology;0;genotyp;hcv;chile;hbv;circul;chile;52;15;0.0115350488021295;12;6;19;4;20;8

928;968;Laparoscopic Treatment of Obese Patients with Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease and Barrett's Esophagus: a Prospective Study;Background: Short-segment Barrett's esophagus (SSBE) or long-segment Barrett's esophagus (LSBE) is the consequence of chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), Which is associated With obesity Frequently. Obesity is a significant risk factor for the development of GERD symptoms, erosive esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus, and esophageal adenocarcinoma. Morbidly obese Patients submitted to gastric bypass WHO Have an incidence of GERD as high as 50% to 100% and Barrett's esophagus Reaches up to 9% of patients. Methods: In this prospective study, we evaluate- the postoperative results after three different procedures-calibrated posterior fundoplication + gastropexy (CFPG) fundoplication + vagotomy + distal gastrectomy + Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy (FVDGRYGJ), and laparoscopic Roux-en resectional Y gastric bypass (LRRYGBP) -among obese patients. Results: In Patients With SSBE WHO submitted to CFPG, the persistence of reflux symptoms and erosive esophagitis endoscopic was Observed in 15% and 20.2% of them, respectively. Patients With LSBE Were submitted to FVDGRYGJ or LRRYGBP Which Significantly improved symptoms and erosive esophagitis Their. No Modifications of SEPS Were Observed in Patients submitted to WHO LRRYGBP before or after the operation. Acid reflux diminished after the three types of surgery Were employed. Patients submitted to WHO LRRYGBP presented to significant reduction of BMI from 41.5 ± 4.3 to 25.7 ± 1.3 kg / m 2 after 12 months.

929;983;Characterization of the Novel ST2/IL-33 System in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease;Background: ST2 Has Been Proposed to be a regulator of inflammation and Th1 / Th2 balance. ST2L is the IL-33 receptor membrane and belongs to the IL-1R family. The soluble variant, st2s, is identical to the extracellular region of ST2L and competes for IL-33 binding, inhibiting receptor signaling. , Although st2s Has Been Associated With Processes in Patients With inflammatory sepsis, trauma, asthma, and autoimmunity, Until now there are no studies showing the role Reported of ST2 / IL-33 in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Methods: Expression of ST2 and IL-33 was determined to in serum and colonic biopsies from IBD patients. ST2 protein was determined to transcript and by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) / immunoblot, respectively, and IL-33 protein by ELISA. Intestinal mucosa localization of ST2 and IL-33 was Conducted by immunofluorescence. Results: st2s in the colonic mucosa transcript was mainly Expressed in UC Patients Crohn's disease rather than or monitoring However, ST2L mRNA Remained constant in all samples. Total protein was ST2 Significantly higher in mucosal samples from active UC Patients With, with a predominant induction of st2s That strongly correlates With serum ST2 levels. Mucosa IL-33 levels higher in UC Were Patients and serum levels barely detected in all Were patient groups. ST2 and IL-33 are in the Expressed Both abundantly cytoplasm of epithelial cells of subjects Control however, in ulcerative colitis Patients ST2 and IL-33 Decreases Showed cytoplasm-nuclear redistribution.

931;1078;International multicenter experience with an over-the-scope clipping device for endoscopic management of GI defects (with video);Background: The over-the-scope clip (CSTO) Provides more durable and full-thickness closure as standard Compared With clips. Only case reports and small case series Have Reported on outcomes of OTSC closure of GI defects. Objective: To describe a large, multicenter Experience with OTSCs for the management of GI defects. Secondary goals to determine success rate Were by type of defect and type of therapy and to determine predictors of treatment outcomes. Design: Multicenter, retrospective study. Setting: multiple, international, academic centers. Patients: Consecutive Patients underwent attempted WHO CSTO placement for GI defects, as a primary or Either as a rescue therapy. Interventions: CSTO placement to attempt closure of GI defects. Main Outcome Measurements: Long-term success of the procedure. Results: A total number of 188 Patients (108 fistulae, perforations 48, 32 leaks) Were included. Long-term success in 60.2% was Achieved of Patients During a median follow-up of 146 days. Rate of successful closure of perforations (90%) and leaks (73.3%) was higher than That Significantly of fistulae (42.9%) (P <0.05). Long-term success was Significantly higher OTSCs Were When applied as primary therapy (69.1% vs. primary rescue 46.9% P = 0.004). On multivariate analysis, Patients Who Had CSTO placement for perforations and leaks HAD Significantly higher long-term success Compared With Those Who Had fistulae (OR 51.4 and 8.36, respectively). Limitations: Retrospective design expertise and multiple operators With Variable With the CSTO device. Conclusion: CSTO is safe and effective therapy for closure of GI defects. Clinical success is Achieved in Patients Undergoing best closure of perforations or leaks When CSTO is used for primary or rescue therapy.

932;1446;Escherichia coli isolates from inflammatory bowel diseases patients survive in macrophages and activate NLRP3 inflammasome;Crohn's disease (CD) is a multifactorial pathology associated With the presence of adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) and NLRP3 polymorphic variants. The presence of intracellular E. coli in other intestinal pathologies (OIP) and the role of NLRP3-inflammasome in the immune response by activated bacteria These Been Investigated Have not. In This study, we characterize Sought to intracellular strains isolated from Patients with CD, ulcerative colitis (UC) and OIP, and analyze NLRP3-inflammasome role in the immune response and bactericidal activity induced in macrophages exposed to invasive bacteria. For esta, isolation from E.coli intracellular ileal biopsies, using gentamicin protection assay-, revealed a prevalence and CFU / biopsy of E. coli higher in biopsies from CD, UC and OIP Patients than in controls. To characterize bacterial isolates, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns, virulence genes, serogroup and phylogenetic group Were Analyzed. We found out bacteria isolated from That GIVEN patient closely related Were and shared virulence factors however, strains from different genetically heterogeneous Patients Were. AIEC Characteristics in isolated strains, Such as invasive and replicative properties, Were Assessed in epithelial cells and macrophages, respectively. Some strains from CD and UC Demonstrated AIEC properties, but not strains from OIP. Furthermore, the role of NLRP3 in pro-inflammatory cytokines and bacterial production was determined to elimination in macrophages. E. coli strains induced IL-1ß through NLRP3-dependent mechanism however, Their elimination by macrophages was independent of NLRP3.

939;2222;Profile of idiosyncratic drug induced liver injury in Latin America. An analysis of published reports;Introduction. Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) remains a major problem for drug development and Represents diagnosis for clinicians to challenging. The absence of specific biomarkers for diagnosing DILI precludes the availability of reliable data on the epidemiology of the disease. In This study we describe the features Aimed to idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity of reports in Latin American Countries. Material and methods. A literature search was performed using the online version of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Google Scholar databases and specific data from Latin America (LA) (Scielo, Lilacs) to Identify any case report or case series of DILI published from 1996 to 2012. From 1996 to 2012, a total number of 176 Patients with DILI Were published in LA, Involving 53 suspicious drugs. The median age in the adult population of 55 years was in Original Patients (17-82) With prevalence of women (67%). Among main therapeutic classes, the rank order was led by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (61 cases) and systemic antibacterial drugs (37 cases). Nimesulide was the single drug responsible for the highest number of cases (53), followed by cyproterone acetate (18), nitrofurantoin (17), Antituberculous drugs (13) and flutamide (12). Thirty two percent of published cases evolved to acute liver failure (ALF), and half of the subjects required liver transplantation or died Eventually. Conclusions.

940;2228;Hormonal pretreatment preserves liver regenerative capacity and minimizes inflammation after partial hepatectomy;Introduction. The treatment of brain dead Donors With combined hormonal resuscitation protocols, Including methylprednisolone (MP) and triiodothyronine (T3) Among others, was developed to Increase the viability and function of transplanted organs, heart and lung Primarily. Even when it has Regarded successful results in term of Donors and organs recovery, ITS effects over specific parameters in organs like the liver are unknown. Material and methods. Male Sprague-Dawley rats pretreated Were With MP (0.34 mg / kg) and / or T3 (0.05 mg / kg) or Their vehicles, and then a partial hepatectomy subjected to 70% of. Three experimental groups and conformed Were Their respective controls: a. T3 b. NaOH c. MP d. vMP and. MP + T3 and f. vMP + NaOH. The groups Were EVALUATED at 0, 16, 24, 72 and 120 h post surgery. The effects of esta protocol on regeneration, liver mass recovery, liver injury, oxidative stress and liver function Were Analyzed. Results. MP + T3 pretreatment does not deleteriously Affect liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy, as shown in the curve of the total mass recovery, Ki67 staining and counting mitosis, and does not alter liver function. In Addition, the oxidative stress treatment and modestly Decreases liver injury, as evidenced by transaminases levels, histological analysis and oxidized proteins content. Conclusion. These preclinical results Indicate That MP + T3 is harmless for post hepatectomy liver tissue regeneration and anti-inflammatory additionally exhibits effects and antioxidant THEREFORE, it would not be contraindicated for the treatment of multiorgan Donors in brain death and Particularly, if the occurrence of small for size syndrome is suspected.;ANNALS OF HEPATOLOGY;2013;Artículo;Gastroenterology & hepatology;0;liver;donor;function;hepatectomi;organ;function;49;16;0.0108695652173913;2;5;18;9;17;32

943;2489;Lambda Interferon Serum Levels in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Infection According to Their Response to Therapy with Pegylated Interferon and Ribavirin;Lambda interferon IL-28A / B and IL-29 serum levels Have Been associated With the course of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. However, there is not information About Cytokine in Patients With These antiviral therapy. We Investigated IL-28A / B and IL-29 serum levels in 45 samples from Patients chronically infected With HCV Genotype 1 and Undergoing Therapy With PEG-IFN / RBV, at baseline and after 12 weeks of therapy, Comparing Those That developed a sustained virologic response (SVR) WITH null responders (NR). IL-28B polymorphisms (rs12979860, rs12980275, rs8099917 and) Were Also considered. We found That, IL-28A / B and IL-29 levels Were not Significantly Different Between SVR and NR Patients at baseline or after 12 weeks of therapy. Rs8099917 TT genotype carriers HAD Significantly higher IL-29 levels at baseline (60.5 vs 19.5 pg / mL p = 0.045) and after 12 weeks of therapy (35 vs 16.5 pg / mL p = 0.023) than non-carriers TT. In conclusion, there Were not Differences in IL-28A / B or IL-29 levels ACCORDING TO response to therapy, suggesting That These cytokines do not play an Important role in viral elimination During treatment, At least not During the first 12 weeks of therapy . Genotypes Associated With IL-28B high levels May be related to a mechanism of protection against infection but are not Involved in the response to antiviral therapy. © 2014 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc ..;JOURNAL OF INTERFERON AND CYTOKINE RESEARCH;2014;Artículo;Gastroenterology & hepatology;0;therapi;week;baselin;genotyp;infect;infect;100;7;0.0221827861579414;13;8;9;5;20;8
944;2635;Phylogenetic Analysis of Hepatitis B Virus Genotype F Complete Genome Sequences From Chilean Patients With Chronic Infection;Molecular epidemiological data Concerning the hepatitis B virus (HBV) in Chile are not known completely. Since the HBV genotype F is the MOST prevalent in the country, the goal of esta study was to Obtain full HBV genome sequences from chronically infected Patients in order to determine Their subgenotypes and the occurrence of resistance-associated mutations. Twenty-one serum samples from antiviral drug-naive Patients With chronic hepatitis B Were subjected to full-length PCR amplification, and the whole Both strands of fully sequenced genomes Were. Phylogenetic analyzes Were performed Along With reference sequences available from GenBank (n = 290). The sequences aligned using Clustal X Were and edited in the SE-AL software. Bayesian phylogenetic analyzes Were Conducted by Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations (MCMC) for 10 million generations in order to Obtain the substitution tree using BEAST. Also Were Analyzed The sequences for the presence of primary drug resistance mutations using CodonCode Aligner Software. The phylogenetic analyzes Indicated That Were all sequences found to be the HBV subgenotype F1b, clustered into four different groups, suggesting That diverse lineages of esta subgenotype May be circulating Within esta population of Chilean patients. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.;JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY;2011;Artículo;Gastroenterology & hepatology;0;sequenc;analyz;hbv;esta;phylogenet;;0;0;0;12;6;19;4;5;8
945;3341;Spectrum of MLH1 and MSH2 Mutations in Chilean Families With Suspected Lynch Syndrome;PURPOSE: Lynch syndrome is the MOST common inherited syndrome of colorectal cancer, Principally Caused by germline mutations in MLH1 and MSH2. We report our experience With the genetic screening in diagnosis of Lynch syndrome in Chile, a country with previously underserved in the capacity to diagnose hereditary colorectal cancer. METHODS: Families from our Familial Colorectal Cancer Registry Were selected for study esta If They brilliant Either Amsterdam I / II or Bethesda criteria for classification of Lynch syndrome. Analysis of colorectal tumors from probands included a microsatellite instability and immunohistochemical study MLH1 and MSH2 for evaluation. Screening of germline mutations was performed by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and DNA sequencing. RESULTS: A total number of 21 families Were EVALUATED, 14 meeting Amsterdam criteria and 7 meeting Bethesda criteria. Tumors in 20 families (95%) Showed microsatellite instability (19 high and 1 low) and 9 of These 20 families (45%) harbored a germline mutation (7 of 13 and 2 of 7 Amsterdam Bethesda families). Identified mutations of the 9, 6 and 3 Were in MLH1 in MSH2. Two of the novel mutations Were 3 Were Previously found in European Populations 1 to 2, and 4 Were Previously found in various ethnic Populations worldwide. Only 2 mutations found in another Were Previously Latin American population (Colombia). In our probands, colorectal cancer was located mainly (57%) in the right or transverse colon. Pedigree information from 104 family members of 21 AFFECTED Studied endometrial cancer families to be Showed The most frequent primary extracolonic tumor, accounting for 15.1% of all cases, followed by stomach (13.2%) and breast cancer (11.3%). Analysis of mitochondrial DNA haplotypes Showed a strong genetic component Amerindian in 15 (71.4%) of the 21 families Analyzed. CONCLUSION: The study of Lynch syndrome in families of different ethnic origins Contributes to the definition of genetic and clinical Differences Among Populations. Wide distribution in other ethnic Populations strongly varying Suggests Origins of 4 the mutations found. , Although cancer phenotype was consistent With Those from other Latin American Populations, only 2 of 9 mutations Were Shared with other South American Populations and 2 novel mutations were found. The Chilean population is Considered to be an admixture of Amerindian and European-mainly Spanish-Populations, producing an ethnic group With significant genetic Differences from Previously Studied Populations. © The ASCRS 2.;DISEASES OF THE COLON & RECTUM;2010;Artículo;Gastroenterology & hepatology;0;famili;popul;mutat;cancer;colorect;cancer;120;4;0.0266193433895297;1;6;19;4;18;9
946;3778;Combined effect of gallic acid and catechin against Escherichia coli;The antimicrobial effect of gallic acid and catechin on Escherichia coli cultures was Investigated. The antimicrobial activity was EVALUATED by measuring the absorbance of liquid culture medium at 600 nm, by an agar-well diffusion method and by scoring colony forming units. Then, the OD600 and CFU / mL values <U+200B><U+200B>Decreased When the medium was Supplemented With gallic. Besides, the CFU / mL Decreased values <U+200B><U+200B>Continuously With the time of exposure to gallic acid in a range of 360 min. Likewise, the diameters of the growth inhibition zones around the wells Increased Gradually With the content of gallic acid or catechin. In summary, Both growth inhibitory effects polyphenols displayed on the bacterium. Further, the antibacterial effects dependent on dose Were, time of exposure and type of polyphenol. Gallic acid Showed a higher anti-E. coli effect Compared To catechin.

949;4320;Increased production of soluble TLR2 by lamina propria mononuclear cells from ulcerative colitis patients;Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) is a type I receptor pattern recognition That has-been shown to Participate in intestinal homeostasis. Increased Its expression in the lamina propria Has Been Associated With the pathogenesis in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), ulcerative colitis: such as (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Recently, soluble TLR2 (sTLR2) Have Been variants shown to counteract inflammatory responses driven by the cognate receptor. DESPITE the roles of TLR2 evident in intestinal immunity, no study has elucidated the production and cellular source of sTLR2 in IBD. Furthermore, an Increase in the population of activated macrophages expressing TLR2 That infiltrates the intestine in IBD Has Been Reported. We Aimed ASSESS first to the production of the UC and CD sTLR2 by organ culture and lamina propria mononuclear biopsies cells (LPMCs) as well as the levels of sTLR2 in serum, and then a cell population from the characterize lamina propria producing the soluble protein.Mucosa explants, LPMCs and serum Were Obtained from UC, CD subjects Patients and control. The level of sTLR2 was higher in conditioned media from organ culture and LPMCs biopsies from UC Patients in comparison to CD and controls. , Moreover, an inverse correlation Between the content of intestinal and serum levels sTLR2 was Observed in UC patients. Additionally, When characterizing the cellular source of the Increased sTLR2 by LPMCs from UC Patients, an Increase in TLR2 + / CD33 + cell population was found. Also, These cells Expressed CX3CR1, Which was related to the Increased levels of intestinal FKN in UC Patients, suggesting a higher proportion of That TLR2 + mononuclear cells infiltrate the lamina propria. The Increased production of sTLR2 Suggests That a differential regulating factor of the innate immune system is present in the intestinal mucosa of UC patients. © 2011 Elsevier GmbH.;IMMUNOBIOLOGY;2012;Artículo;Gastroenterology & hepatology;0;stlr;intestin;tlr;lamina;lpmcs;;0;0;0;12;6;12;8;13;27
950;4398;P2X4 Activation Modulates Volume-sensitive Outwardly Rectifying Chloride Channels in Rat Hepatoma Cells;Volume-sensitive outwardly rectifying (VSOR) Cl- channels are critical for the regulatory volume decrease (RVD) response triggered upon cell swelling. Recent Evidence Indicates That plays an essential role H2O2 in the activation of These channels and That H2O 2 per se activates the channels under isovolumic isotonic conditions. However, a significant difference in the time course for current-induced onset betweenH2O2 and VSOR hypotonicity-mediated Cl - activation is Observed. In Several cell types, cell swelling induced by hypotonic triggers the release of challenges to the extracellular medium ATP, Which in turn, activates purinergic receptors and modulates cell volume regulation. In This study, we addressed the effect of Have purinergic receptor on H2O2-induced activation and hypotonicity-mediated activation VSOR Cl- current. Here we show hepatoma That rat cells (HTC) exposed to hypotonic solution to 33% by Rapidly activating Responded VSOR Cl - current and releasing ATP to the extracellular medium. In contrast, cells exposed to 200 mM H2O2 VSOR Cl- current was Significantly slower onset, and ATP release was not detected. In cells exposed to 11% hypotonicity Either or 200 uM H2O 2 Addition of exogenous ATP in the presence of extracellular Ca 2+ Resulted in a decrease in the half-time for onset VSOR Cl- current. Conversely, in cells overexpress a dominant That-negative mutant of the P2X4 receptor ionotropic challenged with a 33% hypotonic solution, the half-time for onset VSOR Cl- current was Slowed down Significantly. Our results Indicate That, at high hypotonic imbalances, swelling-induced ATP P2X4 purinergic release activates the receptor, in turn modulates Which the time course of onset VSOR Cl- current in a Ca 2+ -dependent extracellular manner. © 2 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.;JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY;2010;Artículo;Gastroenterology & hepatology;0;vsor;current;hypoton;atp;onset;;0;0;0;5;5;5;9;19;12
920;2866;Oral health-related quality of life of older people from three South American cities;Objective: To describe oral health status Subjective and Its association with overall health conditions and socioeconomic factors in the elderly (60 years and older) living in the capital cities With the oldest in South America Populations average. Background: Oral diseases are a public health problem, faq frequently neglected in older adults. In recent years, the Subjective assessment of psychological and social Consequences of the problems related to oral health has-been valued. One of the instruments used to estimate the Oral Health-Quality of Life is the Geriatric Oral Health Assessment (GOHAI). Material and methods: Representative samples from KNOW study (1999-2000) of Santiago (n = 1301), Buenos Aires (n = 1043), and Montevideo (n = 1450) aged 60 and over community-dwelling people. We Assessed OH-QoL (GOHAI), self-reported almost missing teeth, denture use, and self-rated health-, Among other indicators. Logistic regression models (GOHAI <58) for each city, adjusted by sex and age, Were applied. Results: Were GOHAI higher average scores in Montevideo (54.8 ± 6.1) than in Buenos Aires (53.1 ± 7.4) and Santiago (49.9 ± 8.6). A pronounced gradient of the oral condition and GOHAI scores Were Observed Within the three-cities. Denture use -less prevalent in Santiago and more common Among Women- is a protective factor against a poor OH-QoL. Conclusion: Socioeconomic Inequalities in oral health status and OH-QoL are Observed in the three cities. The increase increasing life expectancy emphasizes the need to integrate prevention and treatment Efforts, as a way to Improve OH-QoL over the course of a lifetime. © 2012 The Gerodontology Society and John Wiley & Sons A / S.;GERODONTOLOGY;2013;Artículo;Geriatrics & gerentology;0;health;oral;gohai;citi;qol;health;90;8;0.0199645075421473;14;1;14;1;10;22
921;4379;Age-Dependent Increases in Apoptosis/Necrosis Ratios in Human Lymphocytes Exposed to Oxidative Stress;UNLIKE apoptosis, leading to necrosis Mechanisms are less well Understood. , Moreover, changes in necrosis as a function of age Have not Been Studied in human lymphocytes. H 2O 2-induced death of peripheral lymphocytes (56 healthy Donors, 24-95 years) was EVALUATED by flow cytometry and propidium iodide staining, caspase activation, DNA laddering, and electron microscopy. H 2O 2-induced stress was associated With high levels of necrosis in young Individuals (=30 years), progressively enhanced apoptotic death was Whereas in older Observed Donors, without changes in overall lymphocyte survival. THUS, apoptosis / necrosis ratios Were young versus inverted in elderly (=65 years) Donors. Death was not Accompanied by Increased caspase activity and, accordingly, unaffected by caspase inhibition however, it was almost completely prevented us by ADP ribose polymerase inhibition poly. In summary, aging was associated With changes in the apoptosis / necrosis ratios, rather than susceptibility per se to 2O 2 H-induced death, Which was caspase independent ADP ribose polymerase but poly dependent. Understanding esta switch modes in death in May aid understanding age-related disorders. © The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on Behalf of The Gerontological Society of America.

919;1;Performance measures for in-hospital care of acute ischemic stroke in public hospitals in Chile;Background: The aim of esta study Were to describe acute ischemic stroke Patients care of and adherence to performance Measures, as well as the outcomes of These events, in a sample of Patients Treated in public hospitals in Chile.Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical charts of Patients with ischemic stroke from a sample of seven public hospitals in the Metropolitan Region of Santiago. We Analyzed adherence to the following evidence-based Measures: Clinical evaluation at admission, use of intravenous thrombolysis, dysphagia screening and prescription of antithrombotic therapy at discharge. As we Analyzed Outcome Measures post-stroke pneumonia and 30-day case-fatality. We used a logistic regression model by each outcome With generalized estimating equations, Which Accounted for clustering of Patients Within hospitals and included sex, age (years), clinical status at admission (reduced level of consciousness, speech disturbance, aphasia and hemiplegia), comorbidities , dysphagia screening and neurological evaluation at admission as of acute stroke Measures care.Results: We reviewed the charts of 677 Patients, 52.3% of Which Were men. The mean age was 69.8 years in women and 66.3 years in men. Diagnosis of stroke was confirmed by a computed tomography scan Within 4.5 hours of symptom onset in only 9.6% of the patients. Intravenous thrombolysis was administered in 1.7%. Dysphagia screening was performed in 12.1% (95% CI 9.7-15.0) and antithrombotic therapy was prescribed in 68.9% (95% CI 64.6-72.9). Pneumonia was diagnosed in 23.6% (95% CI 20.4-27.2). Thirty-day fatality was 8.7% (95% CI 6.7-11.3). The variables associated Independently With 30-day case fatality Were age (OR 1.08, 95% 1.06-1.10), pneumonia (OR 7.7, 95% CI 95% 4.0-14.7), aphasia (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.1-5.6) , reduced level of consciousness (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.3-4.4), and speech disturbance (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.0-1.9). No association was found between 30-day case fatality and neurological dysphagia screening or evaluation at admission. The factors associated With post-stroke pneumonia Were female sex (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.0-2.3), age (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.03-1.05), diagnosis of diabetes (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.4-2.4), aphasia (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.5-2.7), hemiplegia (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.4), and reduced level of consciousness on admission (OR 3.4, 95% CI 2.1-5.5). No association was found Between pneumonia and dysphagia screening or neurological evaluation at admission.Conclusions: Adherence to evidence-based Performance Measures was low. Administration of intravenous thrombolysis was low and diagnostic Particularly confirmation of ischemic stroke was delayed. The occurrence of post-stroke pneumonia was frequent and Should be reduced. To improve acute stroke care in Chile, organizational change in the health service is urgently needed. © 2 Hoffmeister et al licensee BioMed Central Ltd.;BMC NEUROLOGY;2013;Artículo;Health care sciences & services;0;stroke;pneumonia;admiss;dysphagia;measur;;0;0;0;9;8;9;5;30;25

The study was located in the cities of Mombasa in Kenya and Valparaiso in Chile, and the impact of the intervention on child nutrition was EVALUATED using a controlled design. The findings Showed That an action research process the educational process using social Known as PLA Could Effectively build the capacity of multisectoral teams to take coordinated action Which in turn built the capacity of communities to sustain them. The impact on child nutrition was inconclusive and needed to be Interpreted Within the context of economic collapse in the intervention area. Four factors Were found to Have Been crucial for creating the enabling environment for effective intersectoral action (i) supportive government policy (ii) broad participation and capacity building (iii) Involving policy makers as advisors and Establishing the credibility of the research and (iii) Strengthening community action. If Lessons Learned From this study can be applied in other Adapted and contexts Then They Could have a significant economic and societal impact on health and nutrition equity in the informal urban settlements. © 2015 The New York Academy of Medicine;JOURNAL OF URBAN HEALTH-BULLETIN OF THE NEW YORK ACADEMY OF MEDICINE;2015;Artículo;Health policy & services;0;action;capac;impact;nutrit;research;;0;0;0;14;1;14;1;27;1
907;1326;The Republic of Chile: An Upper Middle-Income Country at the Crossroads of Economic Development and Aging;Chile is a country with a developing economy and social Rapidly expanding concomitant and Cultural changes. It is expected to Become a developed country Within 10 Years. Also Chile is an Characterized as being in advanced demographic transition. Unique challenges are posed by the intersection of rapid economic development and an aging population, making Chile an intriguing case study for examining the impact of These societal-level trends on the aging experience. This paper highlights Characteristics of This Country essential for understanding emerging ITS aging society.

908;1332;Achieving effective universal health coverage with equity: evidence from Chile;Chile's 'health Guarantees' approach to providing universal and equitable coverage for quality healthcare in a dual public-private health system has generated overall interest. The Program, called RISE, define legally enforceable rights to healthcare benefits for explicit priority health conditions, problems Which incrementally covered 56% of the 75 Representing disease burden Between 2005 and 2009. It was Accompanied by other Health Reform Measures to Increase public financing and public industry planning to secure the Guarantees nationwide, as well as the state's stewardship role. We analysed data from household surveys Conducted before and after the AUGE reform to estimate changes in levels of unmet health need, defined as the lack of a healthcare visit for a health problem occurring in the last 30 days, by age, sex, income, education , health insurance, residence and ethnicity Logistic regression models fitting and using predictive margins. The overall prevalence of unmet health need was much lower in 2009 (17.6%, 95% CI: 16.5%, 18.6%) than in 2000 (30.0%, 95% CI: 28.3%, 31.7%). Differences by income and education Extremes and rural-urban residence Disappeared. In 2009, people Who Had Been in treatment for a condition covered by AUGE in the past year had a lower adjusted prevalence of unmet need for Their recent problem (11.7%, 95% CI: 10.5%, 13.2%) than Who Had not ( 21.0%, 95% CI: 19.6%, 22.4%). DESPITE Including cross-sectional limitations and self-Reported data, our findings Suggest That the Chilean health system more equitable and have Become responsive to need. These changes while Can not Be Directly Attributed to AUGE, They Were Coincident With the Reforms AUGE. However, healthcare equity Concerns are still present, quality of care Relating to, health system barriers and differential access for health conditions are not covered by That AUGE. © The Author 2 All rights reserved.;HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING;2014;Artículo;Health policy & services;0;health;aug;healthcar;need;condit;health;90;8;0.0199645075421473;14;1;14;1;28;6
909;1943;Lessons from scaling up a depression treatment program in primary care in Chile;In Chile, the National Depression Detection and Treatment Program (National Program for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Depression, PNDTD) in primary care is a rare example of an evidence-based Mental Health Program That was scaled up to the national level in a low- or middle-income country. This retrospective study qualitative Aimed to Better Understand how policymakers made the decision to scale up mental health services to the national level, and to explore the elements, contexts, and Processes That Facilitated the decision to Implement and sustain PNDTD. In-depth semistructured Interviews with Key Informants six selected through intentional sampling Were Conducted in August-December 2008. Interviewees Were senior officers at the Ministry of Health WHO Were Directly Involved in the decision to scale up the program. Results yielded four elements pivotal to the decisionmaking process: scientific evidence, teamwork and leadership, strategic alliances, and institutionalization program. Each element Contributed to building consensus, securing funding, attracting resources, and gaining support from policymakers lasting. Additionally, a review of available documentation led the authors to Consider sociopolitical context and use of the media to be Important factors. While research evidence for the effectiveness of mental health services in the primary care setting Continues to Accumulate, low- and middle-income countries Should get started on the lengthy process of scaling up by Incorporating the elements That led to decisionmaking and implementation of the PNDTD in Chile.;REVISTA PANAMERICANA DE SALUD PUBLICA-PAN AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH;2012;Artículo;Health policy & services;0;program;element;health;nation;scale;health;90;8;0.0199645075421473;14;1;14;1;28;6
910;1955;Wheat flour fortification with folic acid: Changes in neural tube defects rates in Chile;In January 2000, Chilean Ministry of Health mandated the Addition of folic acid (FA) in order to wheat flour to reduce the risk of neural tube defects (NTDs). This policy Resulted in significant Increases in serum and red cell folate in women of fertile age 1 year after fortification. To Evaluate the Effect of wheat flour fortification on the prevalence of NTDs in Chile we designed a prospective hospital-based surveillance program to monitor the frequency of NTDs in all births (live and stillbirths) With birth weight =500g at the nine public maternity hospitals of Santiago, Chile from 1999 to 2009. During the pre-fortification period (1999-2000) the NTD rate was 17.1 / 10,000 births in a total number of 120.566 newborns. During the post-fortification period (2001-2009) to the NTD rate Decreased 8.6 / 10,000 births in a Total of 489.915 newborns, Which translates into a reduction rate of 50% (RR: 0.5 95% CI: 0.42 to 0.59) for all NTDs. The rate reduction by type of NTD Studied was: 50% in anencephaly (RR: 0.5 95% CI: 0.38 to 0.67), 42% in cephalocele (RR 0.58 95% CI: 0.37 to 0.89), and 52% in spina bifida (RR 0.48 95% CI: 0.38 to 0.6). Rates showed significant reduction in stillbirths and Both live births: 510.3 to 183.6 / 10,000 (RR = 0.36 95% CI: 0.25 to 0.53) and 13.3 to 7.5 / 10,000 (RR = 0.56 95% CI: .47-.68), respectively . In Chile, fortification of wheat flour With FA has proven to be an effective strategy for the primary prevention of NTDs. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.;AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS PART A;2012;Artículo;Health policy & services;0;birth;fortif;ntds;chile;flour;chile;52;15;0.0115350488021295;9;1;10;3;4;38

Methods: AAM for the population was 15. Estimated years of age and older using Alcohol consumption per capita With combined survey estimates. The Effect of Alcohol on each cause of death was Extracted from the published scientific literature. We used Bayesian hierarchical models to Standardized Mortality Ratio smooth the for each municipality for six groups of causes related to alcohol-consumption (total, neuro-psychiatric, cardiovascular, cancer, injuries and other causes). Results: The percentage of high risk for municipalities With any group of causes in each region ranges from 0% to 87.0%. With high risk municipalities Were Concentrated in south-central and southern Chile for all groups of causes related to alcohol. Conclusions: AAM shows marked geographic risk Concentrations, mainly in south-central and southern regions of Chile. This combination of methods for small-area estimates of AAM is a powerful tool to Identify high risk regions and associated factors, and may be used to inform the local policies and programs. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.;ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS;2015;Artículo;Health policy & services;0;caus;alcohol;aam;municip;risk;risk;47;19;0.0104259094942325;9;2;9;1;10;22

914;2995;Assessment of the implementation of the model of integrated and humanised midwifery health services in Santiago, Chile;Objectives: During 2007 the Chilean Ministry of Public Health Introduced the Model of Integrated Health Services and Humanized, in Addition to the Clinical Guide for Humanized Care During Delivery. Three years after STI implementation, a study was Conducted (i) to describe selected clinical outcomes of women WHO received care Within esta model, (ii) to Identify the degree of maternal-newborn well-being and (iii) to explore the perception of esta humanised During labor and delivery attention by professional staff Both the (Obstetricians and midwives) and consumers. Design and method: a cross-sectional, descriptive study using quantitative and qualitative methods Both Conducted With 508 women was delivered in two major WHO hospitals Within the National Health System in the metropolitan area of <U+200B><U+200B>Santiago, Chile, from September 2 Until June 2011. The Validated Methods included a quantitative survey of maternal well-being and an Adapted version of the American College of Nurse-Midwives (ACNM) antepartum and intrapartum Standardized data set. The qualitative methods included six focus groups discussions (fgds), with Midwives, Obstetricians and consumers. Additionally, two in depth interviews Were Carried Out with the directors of the maternity units. Findings: the quantitative findings Showed poor implementation of the guidelines: 92.7% of the women ADH medically induced labors (artificial rupture of the membranes and received oxytocin and epidural anesthesia), and almost one-third of the women reported almost Discontent With the Care They Received . The qualitative findings Showed That the main complaint was perceived by the midwives That the health system was highly hierarchical and medicalised and That the Obstetricians Were not engaged in esta modality of assistance. The women (Consumers) Highlighted That professionals (midwives and Obstetricians) Were highly technically skilled, and They felt confident in Their assistance. However, women receiving Complained About Inadequate treatment from staff These professionals. The Obstetricians Showed no self-critique, Stating That They always Expressed Concern for Their Patients and humanised That They provided professional assistance. Conclusions and Implications for practice: by illuminating the main strengths and weakness With regard to the application of the model, can help These findings to inform strategies and actions to Improve ITS implementation. © 2 Elsevier Ltd.;MIDWIFERY;2013;Artículo;Health policy & services;0;women;midwiv;obstetrician;find;health;health;90;8;0.0199645075421473;14;1;14;1;28;1
915;3038;The four-compartment model of body composition in obese Chilean schoolchildren, by pubertal stage: Comparison with simpler models;Objectives: We Assessed the agreement of body fat and fat-free mass Measured by simpler methods against the four-compartment model (4C). Methods: In 60 schoolchildren obese (body mass index =95th percentile) between the ages of 8 and 13y WHO Were Recruited from one school in Chile, multicompartmental body composition was the use of Estimated With isotopic dilution, plethysmography (BodPod), radiographic absorptiometry ( DEXA), and anthropometric equations. These results Were Compared to Those of the 4C model, Which is Considered the gold standard. Results: For body fat, the 4C model Showed the best agreement With DEXA for boys in Tanner stages I and II (r = 0.971) and With isotopic dilution for boys in Tanner stages III and IV (r = 0.984). The best agreement in girls occurred With isotopic dilution, pubertal stage of Regardless (r = 0.948 for Tanner stages I and II r = 0.978 for Tanner stages III and IV). Both isotopic dilution and the Huang, Ellis, and Deurenberg anthropometric equations in boys underestimated body fat by contrast, DEXA, BodPod, and the Slaughter equation overestimated body fat in boys. All of the equations underestimated body fat in girls. For fat-free mass in Both boys and girls, the 4C model Showed the best agreement With isotopic dilution, pubertal stage Regardless of. The Huang equation Showed the best agreement for boys (r = 0.730 for Tanner stages I and II r = 0.695 for Tanner stages III and IV) and for girls in Tanner stages I and II (r = 0.884). The Ellis equation had the best agreement for girls in Tanner stages III and IV (r = 0.917). Conclusions: For obese Chilean children of Both Sexes, isotopic dilution and DEXA Were the two-compartment methods That had the best agreement With the gold-standard model for Both 4C body fat and fat-free mass These Were followed by the Huang and Ellis anthropometric equations. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.;NUTRITION;2014;Artículo;Health policy & services;0;stage;fat;bodi;tanner;agreement;;0;0;0;15;3;12;3;21;19
916;3157;Twenty years of mental health policies in Chile: Lessons and challenges;Over the last 20 years, Chile has Increased share of the mental health budget and public health ITS Implemented policies Radically Transformed That psychiatric services in the country. Both national and international factors Have Contributed to this process. The implementation of two national mental health plans have led to downsizing Mental hospitals and developing community alternatives, Such as primary health care, mental health community teams, day hospitals, acute psychiatric beds in the general hospitals, and group homes. The annual number of new treatment for persons starting Mental disorders in the public sector, has Increased by 343 percent Between 2004 and 2007, with depression being the condition That motivates the highest frequency of visits. The Chilean experience has-been successful in terms of availability and accessibility of Increasing services and demonstrating with a modicum of That political support, it is possible to Implement an effective and efficient community-based network of primary and secondary care facilities.

917;4086;How can the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) hypothesis contribute to improving health in developing countries?;The relevance of Nutrition During Pregnancy and early infancy in defining short-term health and survival has-been well established. However, the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) Provides a framework paradigm to ASSESS the effect of early nutrition and growth on long-term health. This body of literature shows That has significant Consequences early nutrition on later health and wellbeing. In this article, we briefly present the main Consequences of malnutrition That Affect human growth and development and how the DOHaD Consider Paradigm With its evolutionary implicaciones, might Contribute to better addressing the challenge of Improving nutrition. We examine how esta paradigm is in understanding the Particularly Appropriate health and nutrition transition in country clubs that face the double burden of nutrition-related diseases (acute malnutrition and obesity coexisting With other chronic diseases). We focus on stunting (low height-for-age) to examine the short- as well as long-term Consequences of early malnutrition with a life-course, transgenerational, and multidisciplinary perspective. We present current regional and overall prevalence of stunting and discuss the need to reposition maternal and infant nutrition not only in health and nutrition intervention programs but Also in consideration of the emerging research questions That Should be resolved to better orient program and policy decisions. © 2011 American Society for Nutrition.;AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NUTRITION;2011;Artículo;Health policy & services;0;nutrit;health;earli;consequ;malnutrit;health;90;8;0.0199645075421473;15;1;14;1;27;1

Clinical data of the multi-institutional series, the largest of Its kind as yet, has-been analysed With the aim of answering questions and providing open These long-term follow-up information. Data from 488 Patients Affected by stage I / II EHN-DLBCL was Collected: 300 of the Waldeyer's Ring (WR), 38 of the parotid and salivary glands (PSG), 48 of the thyroid gland (TG), 53 of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses (NPS), 24 of the palate and oral cavity (POC) and 25 more than one Involved With site. Different EHN-DLBCL Arising Have Distinct Characteristics at presentation. The intermediate high risk-modified IPI was 67% in TG, 44% in WR, 38% in PSG and POC and 20% in MS. The worst 5-year survival rate ADH TG-DLBCL (61%) due to the 61% of Patients with a MIPI> 1. The Addition of radiotherapy (CRT) to remitters did not translate into a survival advantage (5-year disease-free survival of 67% in the cRT group vs. 70% in the other). Three of four Central nervous system Recurrences occurred in NPS-DLBCL. Survival of HN-DLBCL DLBCL was inferior to Nodal. This study Showed That EHN-DLBCL remitters Have an inferior survival When Compared to nodal DLBCL, and That the Addition of cRT does not Provide a survival advantage.

845;145;Long Polar Fimbriae of Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 Bind to Extracellular Matrix Proteins;Adherence to intestinal cells is a key process in infection by enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli Caused (EHEC). That Several factors mediate the adhesion of EHEC binding to intestinal cells Have Been described, but the receptors Involved in Their recognition are not fully Characterized. Extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins act as receptors Might Involved in the recognition of Enteric Pathogens, Including EHEC. In This study, we Sought to characterize the binding of EHEC O157: H7 to ECM proteins commonly present in the intestine. We found That EHEC prototype as well as other strains clinical isolates Adhered more abundantly to surfaces coated With fibronectin, laminin, and collagen IV. Further characterization of esta phenotype, by using antiserum raised against the putative LpfA1 major fimbrial subunit and by Addition of mannose, Showed That a reduced binding of EHEC to ECM proteins was Observed in a long polar fimbriae (LPF) mutant. We also found That the two regulators, H-NS and Ler Had an effect in EHEC LPF-mediated binding to ECM, supporting the role of fimbriae These tightly regulated as adherence factors. Purified Lpf major subunit bound to all of the ECM proteins tested. Finally, Increased bacterial adherence was Observed When T84 cells, preincubated With ECM proteins, Were Infected With EHEC. Taken together, These findings Suggest That the interaction of Lpf and ECM proteins Contributes to the EHEC colonization of the gastrointestinal tract. © 2011, American Society for Microbiology.;INFECTION AND IMMUNITY;2011;Artículo;Infectious diseases;0;ehec;ecm;protein;adher;bind;protein;107;5;0.0237355811889973;12;6;6;8;18;4

We applied conventional and molecular diagnostics to identify identity viruses and bacteria associated with cap atypical in Chile. Methods We used sputum and blood cultures, IgG / IgM serology and molecular techniques diagnostic (PCR, reverse transcriptase PCR) for detection of classical and atypical bacteria (Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Legionella pneumoniae) and respiratory viruses (adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV), human metapneumovirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza, rhinovirus, coronavirus) in adults> 18 years old presenting with cap in Santiago from February 2005 to September 2007. Severity at admission was qualified by Fine's pneumonia severity index. Results Overall detection in 356 enrolled adults Were 92 (26%) cases of a bacterial single pathogen, 80 (22%) cases of a viral single pathogen, 60 (17%) cases With bacterial mixed and viral infection and 124 (35%) With no pathogen Identified cases. Streptococcus pneumoniae and RSV Were The most common bacterial and viral pathogens identified. Detection by PCR infectious agent provided greater than conventional techniques sensitivity. To our surprise, no relationship was Observed Between clinical severity and sole or coinfections.

848;430;Worldwide human papillomavirus genotype attribution in over 2000 cases of intraepithelial and invasive lesions of the vulva;Background Human papillomavirus (HPV) in vulvar intraepithelial lesions contribution (VIN) and invasive vulvar cancer (IVC) is not established Cleary. This study Provides data on HPV novel markers in a large series of VIN lesions and IVC. Methods Histologically confirmed VIN and IVC from 39 Countries Were assembled at the Catalan Institute of Oncology (ICO). HPV-DNA detection was done by polymerase chain reaction using SPF-10 broad-spectrum primers and reverse hybridisation genotyping by line probe assay (LiPA 25) (version 1). IVC cases Were tested for p16INK4a by immunohistochemistry (CINtec Histology kit, ROCHE). An IVC was driven Considered if HPV DNA and HPV-Both p16INK4a overexpression Were Observed Simultaneously. Data analyzes included algorithms to calculate allocating multiple infections type-specific logistic regression models and contribution to estimate adjusted prevalence (AP) and Its 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results Of 2296 cases, 587 Were VIN and 1709 IVC. HPV-DNA was detected in 86.7% and 28.6% of the cases respectively. Amongst IVC cases, 25.1% Were Both DNA and HPV-positive p16INK4a. Were IVC cases squamous cell carcinoma Largely keratinising (KSCC) (N = 1234). Overall prevalence of HPV related IVC cases was highest in younger women for any histological subtype. With SCC warty or basaloid features (SCC-WB) (N = 326) Were more likely to be HPV positive and p16 INK4a (AP = 69.5%, CI = 63.6-74.8) versus KSCC (AP = 11.5%, CI = 9.7- 13.5). HPV 16 was the commonest type (72.5%) followed by HPV 33 (6.5%) and HPV 18 (4.6%). Enrichment from VIN to IVC was Significantly high for HPV 45 (8.5-fold). Conclusion Combined data from HPV-DNA testing and p16INK4a are likely to Represent a closer estimate of the actual fraction of IVC induced by HPV.

849;469;Human papillomavirus-16 presence and physical status in lung carcinomas from Asia;Background. , Although human papillomavirus (HPV) genome HAS BEEN DETECTED in lung cancer, STI prevalence is highly variable-around the world. Higher frequencies Have Been Reported in far-east Asian Countries, When Compared With European Countries. The present study analysed the HPV-16 in 60 lung carcinomas presence from the Asian Countries China, Pakistan and Papua New Guinea. Results. HPV-16 was present in 8/59 (13%) samples. According To histological type, HPV-16 was detected in 8/18 (44%) squamous cell carcinomas (SQCS), Which Were mainly from Pakistan 0/38 (0%) adenocarcinomas (ACs), Which Were mainly from China and in 0/4 (0%) small cell carcinomas (SCLCs). The difference was statistically Observed histological significant (p <0.001). HPV-16 viral load was determined to Present using actual-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) it ranged Between 411 to 2345 copies / 100 ng of genomic DNA. HPV-16 genome was found integrated into the host genome in every HPV-16 positive carcinoma. Conclusion. These results support the notion That HPV-16 infection is highly associated With SQCS in Pakistan. Our results show a frequent HPV-16 integration in SQCS, low viral load, Although the casts doubt respect to direct etiological role of HPV in lung carcinomas from Asia. Additional HPV16 characterization is Necessary to Establish a direct or indirect etiological role of HPV in esta malignancy. © 2 Aguayo et al licensee BioMed Central Ltd.;INFECTIOUS AGENTS AND CANCER;2010;Artículo;Infectious diseases;0;hpv;carcinoma;genom;countri;lung;;0;0;0;7;8;20;6;6;17
850;472;Cytomegalovirus Infection in Children Undergoing Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in Chile;Background. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection remains as an Important cause of morbidity and mortality in children Undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Our aim was to ASSESS the incidence, risk factors, and outcome related to CMV infection in children after HSCT in a developing country. Methods. From October 1 1999 to December 31, 2005, we prospectively Patients Studied all HSCT ADMITTED to the unit at Luis Calvo Mackenna Hospital in Santiago, Chile. Serologic studies before transplantation and weekly CMV Infection Surveillance (antigenemia or quantitative PCR) Were Obtained Routinely. Patients With antigenemia positive or quantitative PCR received pre-emptive Therapy With ganciclovir, and cases of unfavorable clinical evolution, persistent positive antigenemia, or PCR quantitative after 14 days of ganciclovir Were Treated With foscarnet. Results. Ninety-seven Patients received HSCT. Their median age was 8 years (range, 3 months to 24 years) and Their overall survival was 67%. CMV reactivation was diagnosed in 26 patients. Of these, three developed CMV disease (two interstitial pneumonia, hemorrhagic cystitis one). One of the Patients With pneumonia died. Risk factors Identified Were pre-transplant serologic status (positive recipient), acute and chronic graft versus host disease (GvHD), GvHD prophylaxis, treatment and antithymocyte globulin With. Conclusions. The rate and prognosis of CMV infection Among children Treated at our HSCT unit is similar to Those Reported from Industrialized Countries.

851;484;Near-Universal Prevalence of Pneumocystis and Associated Increase in Mucus in the Lungs of Infants With Sudden Unexpected Death;Background. Accompanying Pneumocystis without obvious pathology is occasionally Reported in infant autopsied lungs. Its prevalence and significance are unknown. Interestingly, This infection induces mild to strong activation of mucus secretion-related genes in young immunocompetent rodents That Has Been Explored not in infants. Excess mucus is induced by multiple offenders through nonspecific airway pathways and would Explain to cofactor role of Pneumocystis in respiratory disease. We undertook characterization of the prevalence of pneumonia and associated mucus in infant lungs.Methods. Samples from 128 infants (mean age, 101 days) who died unexpectedly in Santiago Suddenly and Were Examined During 1999-2004 for Pneumocystis using nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR) amplification of the P. jirovecii mtLSU ribosomal RNA gene and immunofluorescence microscopy (IF) . Pneumocystis-negative infants 28 days and older and Their age-positives closest Were Studied for MUC5AC expression and Pneumocystis burden by Western blot and quantitative PCR, respectively.Results. Pneumocystis DNA was detected by nPCR in 105 of the 128 infants (82.0%) and Pneumocystis organisms Were Visualized by IF in 99 (94.3%) of the DNA-positive infants. The infection was 3-4 months With commonest at 40 of 41 (97.6%) infants of age That testing positive. MUC5AC was Significantly Increased in Pneumocystis-positive tissue specimens (P =. ). Death was unexplained in 113 (88.3%) infants Pneumocystis was detected in 95 (84.0%) of them vs 10 of 15 (66.7%) With Explained death (P =. 28) .Conclusions. A focal highly Pneumocystis infection associated to Increased mucus expression is almost universally present in the lungs of infants dying unexpectedly in the community Regardless of Autopsy diagnosis. © 2012 The Author.

852;486;Role of Neutralizing Antibodies in Adults With Community-Acquired Pneumonia by Respiratory Syncytial Virus;Background. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) Has Been Implicated in the etiology of adult community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). We Investigated RSV infection in adults with cap Chilean using direct viral detection, Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) and serology (microneutralization assay). Methods. RSV, other respiratory viruses, and bacteria Were Studied by conventional and molecular techniques in adults aged =18 years presenting with cap to the healthcare facilities in Santiago, Chile from February 2005 through December 2007.Results.All enrolled 356 adults with cap Had an acute Collected blood sample at enrollment, and 184 had a convalescent blood sample. RSV was detected in 48 cases (13.4%). Immunofluorescence assay and viral isolation each detected only one infection (0.2%), Whereas RRT-PCR was positive in 32 (8.9%) and serology cases was positive in 20 (10.8%) cases. Were CAP clinical Characteristics like in RSV-infected and non-RSV-infected cases. RSV-specific geometric mean serum-neutralizing antibody titer (GMST) was Significantly lower at admission in the 48 RSV-infected cases Compared With 308 non-RSV-infected adults (GMST in log2: RSV / 8.1 vs 8.9, and RSV / B 9.3 vs 10.4 P <02).. Conclusions. RSV infection is frequent in Chilean adults with cap. Microneutralization assay was as sensitive as RRT-PCR in detecting RSV infection and is a good adjunct diagnostic assay for research. High RSV-specific serum-neutralizing antibody levels associated Were With protection against common and severe infection. The development of a vaccine Could Prevent RSV-related CAP in adults. © 2011 The Author.;CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES;2012;Artículo;Infectious diseases;0;rsv;infect;adult;cap;assay;infect;100;7;0.0221827861579414;9;8;9;10;1;33
853;553;Prevalence of R5 and X4 HIV variants in antiretroviral treatment experienced patients with virologic failure;Background: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) Inhibits virus replication. NEVERTHELESS, ART has the disadvantage of selective resistance and generate adverse events. Coreceptor antagonists are a family of antiretroviral drugs are used That With the prior knowledge of HIV Patients tropism. Objectives: The purpose of this work was to estimate the prevalence of R5 and X4 variants Chilean Among Patients under antiretroviral therapy and virological failure and investigate variables such as plasma viral load (pVL) and CD4 cell count in the Studied population.

855;728;The viral transactivator HBx protein exhibits a high potential for regulation via phosphorylation through an evolutionarily conserved mechanism;Background: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) encodes an oncogenic factor, HBx, Which is a multifunctional protein can induce That dysfunctional regulation of signaling pathways, transcription, and cell cycle progression, Among other Processes, through interactions With target host factors. The subcellular localization of HBx is cytoplasmic and nuclear Both. This dynamic distribution of HBx Could be essential to the multiple roles of the protein at different stages HBV infection During. Transactivational functions of HBx May be exerted Both in the nucleus, via interaction With host DNA-binding proteins, and in the cytoplasm, via signaling pathways. , Although many studies there Have Been Describing different pathways altered by HBx, and Its innumerable binding partners, the molecular mechanism different roles That Regulates ITS has-been difficult to elucidate. Methods. In the current study, we Took a bioinformatics approach to investigate the viral protein HBx Whether Might be regulated via phosphorylation by an evolutionarily conserved mechanism. Results: We found That the phylogenetically conserved residues Ser25 and Ser41 (both the negative regulatory domain Within), and Thr81 (in the transactivation domain) are Predicted to be phosphorylated. By 3D molecular modeling of HBx, we further show These are all waste Predicted to be exposed on the surface of the protein, making them accessible to Easily These types of Modifications. Furthermore, we have also Identified Yin Yang sites That Have the Potential to Might be phosphorylated and O-ß-GlcNAc at the same waste interplay. Conclusions: THUS, we propose the different roles of That HBx displayed in different subcellular locations Might be regulated by an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of posttranslational modification, via phosphorylation. © 2012 Hernandez et al . licensee BioMed Central Ltd.;INFECTIOUS AGENTS AND CANCER;2012;Artículo;Infectious diseases;0;hbx;protein;phosphoryl;regul;via;protein;107;5;0.0237355811889973;5;5;5;8;18;4
856;734;HIV-1 tropism: a comparison between RNA and proviral DNA in routine clinical samples from Chilean patients;Background: HIV in Chile has a rate of 0.01% notification. Coreceptor antagonists are a family of antiretroviral drugs are used That With the prior knowledge of HIV-1 tropism Patients. Viral RNA-based viral tropism detection requires a plasma load =1000 copies / mL, while proviral DNA-based detection can be performed Regardless of plasma viral load. This test is useful in Patients With low or undetectable viral loads and would benefit with a proper therapy. The aim of esta study was to determine the correlation Between RNA and proviral HIV DNA genotypic tropism tests. Findings. Forty three Chilean Patients Were Examined using population-based sequencing V3, and a false-positive rate geno2pheno (FPR) values <U+200B><U+200B>of cutoff 5, 5.75, 10 and 20%. With cutoff of 5.75% to 88.4% concordance in tropism prediction was found after a simultaneous comparison Between HIV tropism RNA and DNA by assessment. In all, five discrepancies (11.6%) Were found, 3 Patients Were R5 RNA / DNA-X4 and X4 two Were RNA / DNA-R5. Proviral DNA enabled the prediction of tropism in Patients with a low or undetectable viral load. For cutoff 5 and 5.75% genotypic testing using Showed proviral DNA at a similar sensitivity for X4 as RNA. We found the highest sensitivity That for detecting the strain occurred X4 With proviral DNA and cutoff of 10 and 20%. Viral loads Were higher than carriers Among X4 strain R5 strain Among carriers (p <0.05). Conclusions: A high degree of concordance was found Between tropism testing With RNA and proviral DNA testing With. Our results Suggest That proviral DNA-based testing genotypic tropism is a useful option for Patients With low or undetectable viral load WHO requires a different therapy. © 2 Ferrer et al . licensee BioMed Central Ltd.;VIROLOGY JOURNAL;2013;Artículo;Infectious diseases;0;dna;tropism;provir;rna;viral;;0;0;0;12;6;9;4;20;8
857;758;Impact of the Novel Influenza A (H1N1) during the 2009 Autumn-Winter Season in a Large Hospital Setting in Santiago, Chile;Background: In Chile, the novel influenza A (H1N1) epidemic Began in the middle-high income area of <U+200B><U+200B>Santiago. Clinical and laboratory surveillance was intensified With the aim to characterize the epidemic and determine ITS impact in a large hospital setting. Methods: Demographic and clinical data Were Obtained from Patients all met the clinical symptoms Whose definition of influenza A (H1N1) infection During The epidemic period. Laboratory confirmation was Obtained by use of a nasopharyngeal antigen detection test for influenza A and / or influenza A (H1N1) polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A case was confirmed Considered if the antigen detection test result for influenza A and / or the PCR test result Were positive. Results: The overall number of emergency department (ED) visits Increased by 88.5% from a mean of 14,489 ED visits in 2006-2008 to a mean of 27.308 ED visits in 2009 During the epidemic period. THERE WERE 10.048 Patients clinically diagnosed WHO Were With influenza A (HlNl), and 78% of Represented They all visits, Of which 4591 (45.6%) Were laboratory confirmed. The median time from symptom onset to diagnosis was one day, and 99.7% of Individuals received antiviral treatment. School-aged children Represented 67% of ED visits at the beginning of the epidemic and 24% of ED visits at the end of the epidemic. Only 2% of cases Were hospitalized of these, 70% of cases occurred in Patients 6-50 years of age, and 32% of cases occurred in Patients Who Had an underlying medical condition. Eleven Patients (age range, 1-53 years) required admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) 6 of These Patients With or Without ADH pneumonia hemodynamic shock. No influenza-associated deaths occurred. Conclusions: Many cases of influenza A (H1N1) occurred in school-aged and adult Individuals WHO required an ED visit These visits Resulted in a low impact on the use of hospital beds. Aggressive ICU management and / or experience in extracorporeal membrane oxygenation Significantly improved outcomes. Early antiviral treatment May Have Played an Important role in the low number of severe cases. Vaccines targeted for school-aged children and young adults May modify the first epidemic wave in the northern hemisphere. © 2 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

858;773;Importance of Legionella pneumophila in the Etiology of Severe Community-Acquired Pneumonia in Santiago, Chile;Background: In US and European literature, Legionella pneumophila is Reported as an etiologic agent of Important severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), but in Chile esta information is lacking. The aim of esta study was to determine the incidence and predictors of severe CAP Identify Caused by L pneumophila in Santiago, Chile. Methods: A multicenter, prospective clinical study lasting 18 months within was Conducted it included all adult Patients With Severe CAP ADMITTED to the ICUs of four hospitals in Santiago. We excluded immunocompromised Patients Were WHO, Had Been hospitalized in the previous 4 weeks, or another disease presented With Their During hospitalization. All data for the diagnosis of severe CAP Were registered, and L pneumophila urinary antigens for serogroup 1 Were determined. Results: A total number of 104 Patients With severe CAP Were included (mean ± SD age 58.3 ± 19.3 years men, 64.4% APACHE (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) II score, 16.7 ± 6.3 Sepsisrelated Organ Failure Assessment score, 6.1 ± 3.2 Pitt Bacteremia Score 3.4 ± 2.5 P O 2 / F IO 2 170.8 ± 87.1). An etiologic agent was identifi ed in 62 Patients (59.6%), with the MOST frequent being Streptococcus pneumoniae (27 Patients [26%]) and L pneumophila (nine Patients [8.6%]). Logistic regression anal ysis Showed That plasma level of sodium ± 130 mEq / L was an independent predictor for L pneumophila severe CAP (OR, 3.11 95% CI 2.5-50.5, P 5 0.002). Overall mortality was 26% and 33% for L pneumophila. The Pitt bacteremia and pneumonia score index score Were the best predictors of mortality. Conclusions: We found That in Santiago, L pneumophila was second to S pneumoniae as the etiologic agent of severe CAP.

859;948;Symptomatic and Asymptomatic Rotavirus and Norovirus Infections During Infancy in a Chilean Birth Cohort;Background: Rotavirus and more recently norovirus Have Been Recognized as 2 of The most common causes of acute diarrhea in children. Comparative analysis of These infections in a birth cohort has performed and can not Been Provide Relevant insight on clinical and viral behaviors. Methods: Mother-infant pairs from middle-low socioeconomic background living in the Metropolitan Region of Chile are being followed for 18 months in two outpatient clinics. Infants are EVALUATED monthly for asymptomatic excretion of rotavirus and norovirus and acute diarrhea During episodes (ADE) for rotavirus, norovirus, and bacterial enteropathogens. EVALUATED severity of ADE is using the Vesikari score. Results: Between July 1, 2006 and September 1, 2008 to the total of 198 children followed for a mean Were of 15.7 months. Asymptomatic rotavirus and norovirus infections Were detected in 1.3% and 8% of 2278 samples and 14% stool compromising 57% of infants, respectively. Incidence of ADE was approximately 0.8 for the first year of life and approximately 0.6 for the 13 to 18 month age group. Rotavirus and norovirus Were detected in 15% and 18% of 145 ADE EVALUATED. Vesikari mean score was 10.4 and 7.4 for rotavirus and norovirus respectively (P = 0.01) and severity was not associated with age of Patients for Either virus. Were Reinfections more common for norovirus asymptomatic episodes: 44% versus 19% (P = 0.01) and borderline for symptomatic episodes: 40% versus 11% (P = 0.08). Rotavirus and Norovirus Genotype G9P8 genogroup II (GII) predominated, Although MOST asymptomatic episodes for nontypable Were Both viruses. None of 19 symptomatic infections GII Norovirus GII had a previous documented infection Compared With GII 10 of 31 asymptomatic infections (OR = 0. 95% CL = 0, 0.59 P = 0.008). Conclusions: Children HAD Suffered a mean of approximately 1.4 ADE by 18 months of age Of which 15% and 18% Were Caused by rotavirus and norovirus, respectively. In rotavirus infections generally more severe than Were norovirus infections and viruses for Both severity was not related to age. Norovirus Were significantly more common reinfections than reinfections but for rotavirus norovirus GII primary infection to confer protection against Seems clinically significant reinfections.

860;949;Prospective Characterization of Norovirus Compared With Rotavirus Acute Diarrhea Episodes in Chilean Children;Background: Rotavirus and more recently noroviruses are main causes of Recognized as moderate to severe acute diarrhea episodes (ADE) in children =5 years of age. Comparing epidemiologic and clinical features of rotavirus norovirus to ADE will aid in the decision-making process required to Develop norovirus vaccines. Methods: Surveillance for ADE occurring in children =5 years of age was Implemented in the emergency department (ED) and ward of a large hospital in Santiago and Valparaiso, and in four outpatient clinics in Santiago. A stool sample was Obtained within 48 hours of consultation for rotavirus detection by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and noroviruses by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. For ED and hospital rotavirus and norovirus ADE Were instructed to monitor parents clinical findings associated With the end of severity Until the episode. The 20-point Vesikari score was used to determine disease severity. Results: Between July 2006 and October 2008 rotaviruses and noroviruses Were detected in 331 (26%) and 224 (18%) of 1913 ADE EVALUATED. The proportion of rotavirus-positive samples in hospital ward, ED, and outpatient clinic was 40%, 26% to 30%, and 13% Compared With 18%, 17% to 19%, and 14% for noroviruses. Mean age and 25% -75% interquartile interval of Children with rotavirus and norovirus ADE Were remarkably similar 15.6 months (9-20), and 15.05 months (9-19), respectively. Rotavirus cases an autumn-winter displayed peak followed 2 to 3 months later by the norovirus peak. The mean (interquartile) for the Vesikari score was 12.9 (11-15) and 11.9 (9-14.5) for rotavirus (N = 331) and norovirus (N = 224) ADE, respectively, P = 0.003. Compared With norovirus, rotavirus ADE Were more common in the 11 to 16 severity score interval (P = 0.006), had a higher maximum output in a stool given day (P = 0.01) and more frequent fever (P <0.0001). Duration of diarrhea, presence, duration and intensity of vomiting, and intensity of fever did not differ Between viruses. Mixed infections rotavirus and norovirus Were uncommon (<1%) and not clinically more severe. Clinical severity of ADE in young infants was similarly for rotavirus and lower (P = .03) for noroviruses Compared with older children. Conclusion: Noroviruses are a significant cause of moderate to severe endemic ADE in Chilean children. Significantly, Although less severe than rotavirus as a group, Most episodes norovirus moderate to severe Were clinically. An effective vaccine would be of norovirus significant additional benefit to the current rotavirus vaccine in decreasing disease burden associated With ADE. © 2 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.;PEDIATRIC INFECTIOUS DISEASE JOURNAL;2010;Artículo;Infectious diseases;0;norovirus;rotavirus;ade;sever;clinic;clinic;137;3;0.0303904170363798;9;8;9;10;1;38
861;1167;Baseline HIV-1 resistance, virological outcomes, and emergent resistance in the SECOND-LINE trial: an exploratory analysis;Background: WHO-recommended second-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) of a pharmacologically enhanced (boosted) plus protease inhibitor nucleoside or nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NtRTIs) Might be compromised by resistance. Results of the 96 week SECOND-LINE randomized trial Showed That NtRTI-sparing Art with ritonavir-boosted lopinavir and raltegravir (raltegravir-group) provided non-inferior efficacy to ritonavir-boosted lopinavir and two or three NtRTIs (NtRTI-group) in participants with virological failure composed of a first-line regimen of a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor plus two NtRTIs. We report the relation of baseline virological virological failure and resistance With emergent resistance on study. Methods: As part of the open-label randomized trial SECOND-LINE, second-line ART NtRTI selection was made by Either Genotype (local laboratory) or algorithm. Genotypic resistance for the Entire cohort at baseline was Assessed on samples stored at the central laboratory. Virological failure was defined as plasma viral load greater than 200 copies per mL. Baseline viral isolates Were Assigned genotypic sensitivity scores (GSSs) by use of the Stanford HIV Database Version 6.3.1: a global GSS (gGSS), defined as the combined lamivudine or emtricitabine for GSS, abacavir, zidovudine, stavudine, didanosine, and tenofovir and a specific GSS (SGSS) defined as the GSS for the ART regimen Initiated by a specific participant. Emergent resistance was reported almost on samples with a viral load greater than 500 copies per mL. We used multivariate logistic regression to ASSESS With backward elimination predictors of virological failure and emergent resistance. Findings: From April 19, 2, to July 22, 2, 271 Patients Were included in the NtRTI group and raltegravir and 270 in the group. In the group NtRTI 215 ADH sequence data available baseline, and 240 viral load measurements at ADH 96 weeks in the raltegravir group ADH 236 and 255 data sequence baseline viral load measurements at ADH 96 weeks. Median (IQR) gGSS was 3 · 0 (1 · 3-4 · 3) in the NtRTI group and 3 · 0 (1 · 0-4 · 3) in the raltegravir group. The median SGSS in the NtRTI group was 1 · 0 (0 · 5-1 · 8). Showed significant associations multivariate analysis Between virological failure and less than complete adherence at week 4 (odds ratio [OR] 2 · 18, 95% CI 1 · 07-4 · 47 p = 0 · 03) and week 48 (2 · 49 , 1 · 09-5 · 69 p = 0 · 03), baseline viral load greater than plasma 100,000 copies per mL (3 · 43, 1 · 70-6 · 94 p = 0 · 0006), gGSS & gt baseline , 4 · 25 (4 · 73, 1 · 94-11 · 6 p = 0 · 0007), and being Hispanic (3 · 13, 1 · 21-8 · 13 p = 0 · 02) or African (3 · 49, 1 · 68-7 · 28 p = 0 · 0008) rather than Asian. We Observed mutations in one major emergent (1%) of 129 participants for protease (both groups), eight (13%) of 64 for reverse transcriptase (NtRTI group) and 16 (20%) of 79 for integrase. Emergent resistance was associated With the raltegravir group (OR 2 · 47, 95% CI 1 · 02-5 · 99 p = 0 · 05), baseline log10 viral load (1 · 83, 1 · 12-2 · 97 p = 0 · 02), and absence of the Lys65Arg (K65R) or Lys70Glu (K70E) mutation at baseline (3 · 18, 1 · 12-9 · 02 p = 0 · 03). Interpretation: Poor adherence was a major determinant of virological failure in people on second-line ART. In Settings with limited resources, optimization of investment in adherence rather than implementation of drug resistance testing Might be advisable.

862;1305;Statistical phylogeography of Chagas disease vector Triatoma infestans: Testing biogeographic hypotheses of dispersal;Chagas disease is one of the Most Important vector-borne diseases in Latin America. The disease, Caused by the flagellate protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, is commonly transmitted to humans by Triatoma infestans in South America. Using mitochondrial DNA sequences, we Assessed Biogeographic alternative scenarios of dispersal of T. infestans coalescence using simulations. We Also Assessed phylogeographic structure and spatial genetics of T. infestans in Chile. Two major routes of dispersal in southern South America Were a dual-supported Including origin of T. infestans in Chile. Identified Phylogeographic analyzes two primary clades With Chilean haplotypes partitioned into cluster With Either a northern Peruvian and Bolivian haplotypes or a north-center cluster With Argentinean and Uruguayan haplotypes. The North-Central clade is further divided into two Subgroups. Domestic and sylvatic T. infestans in Central Chile Were not segregated in the phylogeographic reconstruction. Spatial Analyzes show higher genetic distances in northern Chile, the presence of congruent With two divergent lineages of T. infestans. Phylogenetic evidence does not unequivocally support the hypothesized Bolivian origin of T. infestans, so we discuss alternative scenarios. © 2 Elsevier B.V.;INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION;2011;Artículo;Infectious diseases;0;infestan;chile;america;haplotyp;phylogeograph;chile;52;15;0.0115350488021295;6;4;17;4;5;8
863;1335;Antifungal activity of low molecular weight chitosan against clinical isolates of Candida spp.;Chitosan is a polymer derived from chitin naturally, a structural component of fungi, insects and shrimp, Which exerts antimicrobial effects against bacteria and fungi. The aim was to study de este investigate the in vitro antifungal activity of low molecular weight chitosan (LMWC), and the potential synergy Between chitosan and antifungal drug used to Currently, fluconazole. The in vitro minimal inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) of fluconazole against chitosan and 105 clinical isolates Candida Were Measured by the broth microdilution method. LMWC exhibited a significant antifungal activity, over 89.9% of inhibiting the Examined clinical isolates (68.6% Of which was completely inhibited). The species included fluconazole-resistant strains Several less susceptible species and C. glabrata: such as, Which was inhibited at a concentration of 4.8 mg / l LMWC. , Although some strains at pH 7.0 Were susceptible to antifungal activity of LMWC was greater at pH 4.0 Observed. There was no evidence of a synergistic effect of the combination of LMWC and fluconazole at pH 7.0. This is the first report in Which the antifungal activity of LMWC was Investigated With clinical Candida strains. The use of an antifungal compound as LMWC opens new therapeutic perspectives, as the low toxicity of LMWC in humans supports ITS use in new applications in an environment of pH 4.04.5, Such as a topical agent for vulvovaginal candidiasis. © 2 ISHAM.;MEDICAL MYCOLOGY;2010;Artículo;Infectious diseases;0;lmwc;antifung;activ;chitosan;fluconazol;activ;155;1;0.0343833185448092;12;6;6;4;18;42

865;1658;Identification of Coli Surface Antigen 23, a Novel Adhesin of Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli;Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is an Important causes of diarrhea, mainly in developing countries. , Although there are 25 different ETEC strains adhesins Described in Affecting humans, Between 15% and 50% of the clinical isolates from different geographical regions are negative for adhesins These, suggesting additional unidentified That Might be present adhesion determinants. Here, we report the discovery of coli Surface Antigen 23 (S23), a novel by an ETEC adhesin Expressed O4 serogroup strain (ETEC 1766th), Which was negative for the Previously Known ETEC adhesins, albeit it has the ability to adhere to Caco- 2 cells. CS23 is encoded by an 8.8-kb locus Which contains nine open reading frames (ORFs), 7 of them sharing significant genes required for identity With assembly of K88-related fimbriae. This gene locus, named aal (adhesion-associated locus), is required for the adhesion ability of ETEC 1766th and was able to confer adhesive esta nonadherent phenotype to a E.coli HB101 strain. The CS23 major structural subunit, Aale, shares Identity With limited Known pilin proteins, and it is more closely related to the CS13 pilin protein CSHE, Carried by human ETEC strains.

866;1659;Distribution of Classical and Nonclassical Virulence Genes in Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli Isolates from Chilean Children and tRNA Gene Screening for Putative Insertion Sites for Genomic Islands;Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is an Important causes of diarrhea. Three adhesins (Tia, TIBA, ETPA), an iron acquisition system (IRP1, IRP2, and FyuA), a GTPase (LEOA), and an autotransporter (Eata) are ETEC virulence-related proteins That, in contrast to the classical virulence factors (enterotoxins and fimbrial colonization factors) Have Been not heretofore targets in characterizing isolates from epidemiological studies. Here, we determined to the occurrence of These nonclassical virulence genes in ETEC isolates from 103 Chilean Children with diarrhea and Described Their association with O serogroups and classical virulence determinants. Because tia, LEOA, IRP2, and fyuA are harbored by pathogenicity islands inserted into the selC and asnt tRNA genes (tDNAs), we Analyzed regions flanking the loci These. Ten additional tDNAs Were Also screened to Identify hot spots for genetic insertions. Associations Between The most frequent serogroups and classical colonization factor (CF) -toxin profiles included O6 / LT-STh / CS1-CS3-S21 (ie, O6 serogroup, heat-labile [LT] and human heat-stable [STh] enterotoxins, and CFs CS1, -3 and -21), O6 / LT-STh / CS2-CS3-CS21, O104 and O127-/ STh / CFAI-CS21. The Eata and ETPA genes Were detected in more than 70% of the collection, Including diverse serogroups and virulence profiles. Sixteen percent of the ETEC strains Were classical and nonclassical negative for adhesins, suggesting the presence of unknown determinants of adhesion. The Leux, thrW, and ASNT tDNAs more than Were disrupted in 65% of strains, suggesting hot spots They are for the insertion of mobile elements. Sequences similar to integrase genes Were Identified next to the thrW, ASNT, pheV, and selC tDNAs. We propose the EATA and ETPA That Should be included in genes characterizations of ETEC isolates in future epidemiological studies to determine Their prevalence in other geographical regions. Sequencing of tDNA-associated genetic insertions Might Identify new ETEC virulence determinants. Copyright © 2011, American Society for Microbiology.

867;1721;Identification of Cell Surface-Exposed Proteins Involved in the Fimbria-Mediated Adherence of Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli to Intestinal Cells;Fimbriae-mediated adherence to the intestinal epithelia is a key step in enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) pathogenesis. To date, four fimbriae Have Been Described for EAEC aggregative adherence fimbria II (AAF / II) is the Most Important factor for adherence prototype EAEC strain 042. Previously, we Described That results showing extracellular matrix (ECM) components Might Be Involved in the recognition of AAF / II fimbriae by intestinal cells. In This study, we Sought to Identify potential novel receptors on intestinal epithelial cells Recognized by the AAF / II fimbriae. AAFA-dsc purified protein, the major subunit of AAF / II fimbriae, was incubated with a monolayer of T84 cells, cross-linked to the cell surface-exposed proteins T84, and immunoprecipitated by using anti-AAFA antibodies. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS / MS) analysis of cellular proteins bound to protein Aafa-dsc Identified laminin (previously Recognized as a potential receptor for AAF / II) and cytokeratin 8 (CK8). Involvement of the major subunit of AAF / II fimbriae (Aafa protein) in the binding to recombinant CK8 was confirmed by adherence assays With purified AAF / II fimbriae, Aafa-dsc protein, and strain 042, Moreover, HEp-2 cells transfected With CK8 small interfering RNA (siRNA) Showed reduced adherence Compared with 042 cells transfected with siRNA as a scrambled control. Adherence of 042 to HEp-2 cells preincubated With ECM proteins or antibodies against CK8 was Substantially reduced. Altogether, our results supported the notion of a role of CK8 as a potential receptor for EAEC. © 2014, American Society for Microbiology.;INFECTION AND IMMUNITY;2014;Artículo;Infectious diseases;0;fimbria;aaf;protein;adher;aafa;protein;107;5;0.0237355811889973;12;6;6;8;3;4

In conclusion, hMPV is a cause of acute lower Relevant respiratory infection in children and the potential Chilean novel cluster of group A Emphasize the need for further regional genetic variability studies. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.;JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY;2009;Artículo;Infectious diseases;0;hmpv;acut;infect;lower;respiratori;infect;100;7;0.0221827861579414;9;8;6;4;1;42
871;2045;Pneumocystis Colonization Is Highly Prevalent in the Autopsied Lungs of the General Population;Increasing reports of Pneumocystis DNA in noninvasive respiratory specimens from asymptomatic immunocompetent adults and the characteristic of Pneumocystis lung tropism Suggest That asymptomatic infections pulmonary Pneumocystis With Occur after primary infection. However, studies searching for Pneumocystis in the autopsied lungs of healthy immunocompetent adults Have not Met With success. Methods. Lungs of People Who died of violent causes (accidents, homicide, and suicide) and of nonviolent causes (diseases Causing a rapid demise in the street) in Santiago, Chile-For Whom an autopsy was legally required-were Examined for Pneumocystis by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the mitochondrial DNA large subunit ribosomal RNA gene-specific P. jiroveci and immunofluorescent microscopic analysis. Lung tissue concentration methods and analysis of ~ 3% of the weight of the right upper lobe (RUL) Were needed to reach the threshold sensitivity of the assays. Individuals determined to be P. jiroveci to negative after analysis of 3% of the weight RUL in the violent death group Were confirmed to be negative by analyzing tissue additional, totaling 6% -7% of the weight RUL. Results. P. jiroveci was IDENTIFIED BY nested PCR in 50 (64.9%) of 77 Individuals (34 [61.8%] of 55 violent death in the group and 15 [78.9%] of 19 in the nonviolent death group P> 0.05) and additionally by microscopic analysis in all tested positive for WHO Individuals P. jirovecii DNA violent death in the group.

873;2054;Evaluation of the immune response against immature viral particles of infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV): A new model to develop an attenuated vaccine;Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) is a worldwide problem freshwater and seawater Affecting Both fish. Vaccines developed against IPNV are not as efficient in the field as They are in tests. , Moreover, research in the development of vaccines against IPNV has shown Often That Can Stimulate vaccines the immune response of fish antibodies but do not protect against IPNV Efficiently. In fact, sometimes dead infected fish show high antibody titers against IPNV. This Suggests That the magnitude of the total antibodies stimulated by the vaccine Is not Necessarily related to the level of protection against IPN, suggesting a new method That is needed to Evaluate vaccine of the immune system stimulation. We propose in vitro evaluation of the non-specific cytotoxic cells (NCC) of the innate immune response, in Addition to specific humoral response. , Moreover, it is Necessary to Develop Innovative Methods to Improve fish vaccines. In This work, IPNV replicative intermediaries (provirus) Were used to inject rainbow trout fry, Which is the MOST vulnerable state to IPNV. To Evaluate the immune response triggered by esta vaccine, NCC and the total and neutralizing antibodies against IPNV and the provirus Were determined. Results Indicated That activity NCC in rainbow trout fry is triggered by IPNV infection. Both IPNV and the provirus Stimulate humoral immune response and NCC in rainbow trout fry. , Although the full antibodies triggered by the provirus Were half of That triggered by IPNV infection, the number of neutralizing antibodies was like in the two treatments. This Suggests That the ratio of neutralizing antibodies is higher Among the antibodies stimulated by provirons than stimulated by IPNV Among Those infection. THUS, immature provirus is sufficient to activate immune response and is a good candidate as an attenuated vaccine in rainbow trout fry. In Addition, neutralizing antibodies, Together with non-specific cytotoxic activity, are more suitable strategy for new vaccines to evaluate- than humoral immune response alone. © 2012.;VACCINE;2012;Artículo;Infectious diseases;0;ipnv;antibodi;vaccin;immun;respons;;0;0;0;12;6;12;5;13;29

876;2611;Wing shape differentiation of Mepraia species (Hemiptera: Reduviidae);Mepraia is an endemic genus found in the semiarid and arid regions of north-central Chile. Until 1998, the only Mepraia was spinolai species of the genus, distributed in coastal and inland valleys from Chile between 18 ° and 34 ° S. However, on the basis of morphological characters and karyotype, coastal desert between 18 ° and Populations 26 ° S Were RANKED as a new species, Mepraia gajardoi. Recently, genetic studies using nuclear and mitochondrial markers on Mepraia Populations Suggest That the geographical criterion to separate the two species Should be reviewed. Mepraia species show conspicuous alary polymorphism, unique in the triatomine subfamily. Females are invariably of Both species micropterous, while evils of M. spinolai can be micropterous, brachypterous or macropterous, and only brachypterous in M. gajardoi. In This study, we use geometric morphometrics analyzes to compare male wings of M. spinolai and M. gajardoi from Natural Populations, in order to examine If These two species diverged in alary Have shape. As expected, we found That brachypterous wings of Both species are smaller than macropterous wings of M. spinolai. Additionally, we detected clear Differences in shape on wings of M. gajardoi and M. spinolai, not attributable to Allometric effects. For last, a new Alary phenotype, vestigial wings With insects, was Described here for the first time. In conclusion, our analyzes on wings of Mepraia separate two distinct species groups consistent With the two Described species. However, our findings of vestigial wings in some coastal areas of the north part of Chile can not rule out the existence of a hybrid zone. © 2 Elsevier B.V.;INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION;2011;Artículo;Infectious diseases;0;wing;mepraia;spinolai;gajardoi;alari;;0;0;0;12;6;12;4;6;8

881;3;Hepatitis B prevalence and influence on HIV treatment outcome and mortality in the Chilean AIDS Cohort;Objectives: To analyze the prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) co-infection and Its influence on mortality and treatment outcome Within a large AIDS cohort in Chile. Methods: Clinical and epidemiological data from the Chilean AIDS Cohort Were Analyzed retrospectively. Adult Patients tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) During the time period of October 2001 to October 2007 Were included. Results: Of 5115 Patients Cohort, 1907 met the inclusion criteria. The prevalence of HBV infection was co-8.4%. Overall mortality rates Were 2.15 and 1.77 per 100 person-years for HBsAg-positive and HIV-negative HBsAg Patients, respectively, with a mortality rate ratio of 1.22 (95% confidence interval 0.58-2.54). Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox regression analysis did not show significant Differences Between the groups. Virological and immunological responses to antiretroviral therapy (ART) Were not influenced by HBsAg status, but in co-infected Patients, was more initial ART Frequently changed. Conclusions: The prevalence of hepatitis B co-infection was 8.4%, indicating a markedly elevated risk hepatitis B Compared to the overall population in Chile. Neither treatment outcome nor overall mortality was influenced by hepatitis B co-infection. Still, Patients With hepatitis B co-infection ADH less stable ART regimens, Which Might be related to a higher risk of hepatotoxic drug effects. © 2.;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES;2013;Artículo;Infectious diseases;0;hepat;infect;hbsag;mortal;art;infect;100;7;0.0221827861579414;9;8;9;5;1;17
882;3016;Seroepidemiological study of Pneumocystis jirovecii infection in healthy infants in Chile using recombinant fragments of the P. jirovecii major surface glycoprotein;Objectives: To characterize the features of seroepidemiological jirovecii infection in healthy children using overlapping Chilean fragments (A, B, C) of the major surface glycoprotein P. jiroveci (Msg). Methods: Serum antibodies to msgA, MSGB, and MsgC Were Measured every 2 months by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 45 Chilean infants from age 2 months to About 2 years. Results: Peak antibody levels (usually at age 6 months Reached) and the force (or rate) of infection Were somewhat greater than for MSGA for MsgC. Significant seasonal variation in antibody levels was found only With MSGA. Respiratory infections occurred in MOST children, but nasopharyngeal aspirates Were of limited value in detecting the organism. In contrast, serological responses commonly occurred, and higher levels only to MsgC Were Significantly related to the number of infections. Conclusions: Serological responses to recombinant Msg Provide new insights into fragments the epidemiological and clinical features of P. jirovecii infection of early childhood.

883;3130;Characterization of Genomic Island 3 and Genetic Variability of Chilean Field Strains of Brucella abortus;One of the capabilities developed by bacteria is the ability to gain large fragments of DNA from other bacteria or to lose portions of Their Own genomes. Among These are the fragments Exchangeable genomic islands (GIs). Nine IMs Have been identified in Brucella, and genomic island 3 (GI-3) is shared by two pathogenic species, B. melitensis and B. abortus. GI-3 encodes proteins mostly unknown. One of the AIMS de este study was to perform Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) on field isolates of B. abortus from Chile to determine Whether These are clonally related isolates. Furthermore, we focused on the characterization of GI-3, studying the genetic ITS organization and conservation of the GI-3 sequence using PCR techniques: such as tilingpath (TP-PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism-PCR (PCR-RFLP). Our results, after PFGE was performed on 69 field isolates of B. abortus from Chile, Showed That Were the genetically homogeneous strains. To Increase the power of genetic discrimination Among These strains, we used multiple locus Variable-number tandem-repeat (VNTR) analysis With 16 loci (MLVA-16). The results Obtained by MLVA-16 Showed That the strains of B. abortus That Were genetically heterogeneous and MOST of them clustered ACCORDING TO Their geographic origin. Of the genetic loci Studied, was the one panel 2B Describing the highest diversity in the analysis, as well as in 2A locus Bruce19 panel. In relation to the study of GI-3, our experimental analysis by TP-PCR and confirmed Identified That GI-3 is present in all wild strains of B. abortus, demonstrating the high stability of GI-3 gene cluster in Chilean field strains.

816;1693;Aldosterone Promotes Autoimmune Damage by Enhancing Th17-Mediated Immunity;Excessive production of aldosterone leads to the development of cardiovascular disease and hypertension by generating an inflammatory state That Can Be Promoted by T cell immunity. Because nature and intensity of T cell responses is controlled by dendritic cells (DCs), it is Important to Evaluate Whether the function of These cells can be modulated by aldosterone. In This study we show That the activation of aldosterone augmented CD8 + T cells in a DC-dependent fashion. Consistently, the mineralocorticoid receptor was Expressed by DCs, Which Showed activation of MAPK pathway and secreted IL-6 and TGF-ß in response to aldosterone. In Addition, DCs stimulated aldosterone With Impose a Th17 phenotype CD4 + T cells to, Which Have Been recently associated With the promotion of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Accordingly, we Observed That Enhances the aldosterone autoimmune encephalomyelitis progression of experimental, an autoimmune disease Promoted by Th17 cells. In Addition, mineralocorticoid receptor blockade of the effects on aldosterone preventer all DCs and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis attenuated development in mice aldosterone-treated.

819;1750;Gap Junction Intercellular Communications Regulate NK Cell Activation and Modulate NK Cytotoxic Capacity;Gap junctions (GJS) mediate intercellular communication Between adjacent cells. Previously, we Showed That connexin 43 (Cx43), the main GJ protein in the immune system, Ag Mediates human dendritic cells Between transfer (DCs) and is Recruited to the immunological synapse During T cell priming. This crosstalk Contributed to T cell activation, intracellular Ca2 + responses, and cytokine release. However, the role of NK cell activation in Gjs by DCs and NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity against tumor cells remains unknown. In This study, we found polarization of Cx43 at the NK / DC and NK / tumor cell-contact sites, Accompanied by the formation of functional Gjs Between NK / NK and DCs / tumor cells, respectively. Cx43-mediated intercellular communication GJ-(GJIC) between human NK and DCs was bidirectional. Blockage of Cx43 GJIC inhibited NK-cell activation, though it AFFECTED neither the phenotype nor the function of DCs. Cx43 knockdown or inhibition mimetic peptides using CD69 and CD25 Greatly reduced IFN-g expression and release by DC-stimulated NK cells. , Moreover, blocking Cx43 strongly inhibited the NK cell-mediated tumor cell lysis associated granzyme B With inhibition of Ca2 + activity and Influx. Our data Identify a novel and active role for Cx43 GJIC in human NK-cell activation and anti-tumor effector functions That May be Important for the design of new immune therapeutic strategies.

Here we Investigated the single contribution of AHCC and CCHB subunits from Concholepas hemocyanin (CCH) to humoral immune response in vivo and Their pre-clinical evaluation as immunotherapeutic agent in a mice model bladder cancer, in relation to Their biochemical properties. To this end, purified and well subunits Were Characterized. Were Obtained by Homogeneous subunits anionic exchange chromatography, and its Purity Assessed by electrophoretic and immunochemical methods. While CCH each subunit contains eight functional units showing partial cross reaction, the vibrational spectral analysis spectral Showed Several Differences, Differences Between suggesting structural them. In Addition, we Demonstrated Differences in the carbohydrate content: 3.6% AHCC had a w / w sugar and N- With Both O-linked moieties. In turn, had a 2.5% CCHB w / w sugar With N-linked, O-linked moieties while Were Nearly absent. Considering These Differences, it was not possible to predict a priori Whether the immunogenic and immunotherapeutic properties of subunits Might be like. Surprisingly, Both subunits by itself induced a humoral response, and Showed an antitumor effect in the bladder carcinoma cell line MBT-2. However, When Were Analyzed immunologic parameters, CCHAs Showed better efficiency than CCHB. No allergic reactions or any toxic effects in mice Observed Were Treated With CCHAs, ITS sustaining potential therapeutic use. Our study supports CCHAs That accounts for the subunit Most Important features Involved in the immunogenicity of CCH, Such as better hydrophilicity and higher content of carbohydrates. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

821;2031;Trypanosoma cruzi calreticulin: A novel virulence factor that binds complement C1 on the parasite surface and promotes infectivity;In Trypanosoma cruzi, calreticulin (TcCRT) translocates from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the area of <U+200B><U+200B>flagellum emergence. We propose HEREIN That the parasite use to capture molecule esta complement C1, in an infective apoptotic mimicry strategy. THUS, TcCRT / C1 interactions, Besides the classical pathway of inhibiting complement activation as shown in our laboratories Previously, infectivity Also will promote. This fact correlates With significant Increases in TcCRT mRNA levels During early stages of infection VERO cell line. In vitro, the globular C1q collagenous domains and bind Simultaneously TcCRT and aggregated Igs antigen, respectively. Accordingly, Immunizations mouse humoral responses induced TcCRT With That, after challenge, Correlated With Increased parasitemia. THUS, on the parasite surface, whole anti-Igs TcCRT deposits on trypomastigotes Promote C1 while, as expected, F (ab ') 2 fragments decrease it. Likewise, pretreatment of the parasites With anti-TcCRT whole antibodies parasitemia and mortality augmented in mice. In contrast, pretreatment with F (ab ') 2 fragments anti-TcCRT, devoid of Their capacity to C1q binding sites Provide additional, was protective. Most Important, while pretreatment of trypomastigotes C1q With Increased infectivity in the murine cell line RAW, as well as mice mortality and parasitemia, the F (ab ') 2 fragments Significantly interfered With the C1q-dependent infectivity. Differently from other surface molecules Involved in infectivity, TcCRT use C1 as an adapter molecule to Recognize host cells.

CD14 + HLA-DR / low MDSC Have Been detected in a great number of malignancies, Including melanoma. MDSC are Known to be impaired in Their ability to differentiate along the myeloid lineage, e.g., into dendritic cells (DC). This is a concern for utilization of monocyte-derived DC for vaccination of Patients With melanoma or other cancers exhibiting accumulation of CD14 + MDSC. When producing DC ACCORDING TO standard operating procedures of two Currently ongoing clinical trials, we found That MDSC co-purified monocytes isolated by elutriation With. MDSC did not Affect yield frequencies or viability of the produced DC, but induced a dose-dependent decrease in DC maturation, ability to take up antigen, migrate and induce T-cell IFN production. Changes in DC Characteristics When Were MOST remarkable 'pathological' frequencies of> 50% CD14 + HLA-DR cells Were present in the starting culture. The impaired quality DC Could not be altered cytokine production Explained by oxidative stress Increased or in the cultures. Tracking of HLA-DR cells Throughout the culture period revealed the That Were Observed changes due to the partially impaired maturation and functionality of the HLA-DR population originally, but Also to Their negative effects on HLA-DR + cells.

In This study, Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used as a vehicle to deliver PCV2 antigen in a preliminary attempt to Develop an oral vaccine, and Its immunogenic potential in mice was tested after oral gavage-mediated delivery. The cap gene with a yeast-optimized codon usage sequence (opt-cap) was chemically synthesized and cloned into Escherichia coli / Saccharomyces cerevisiae shuttle vector pYES2, under the Control of the Gal1 promoter. Intracellular expression of the Cap protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis and Its antigenic properties Were Compared With Those of baculovirus / insect cell-produced Cap protein derived from the native gene PCV2 cap. It was further Demonstrated by electron micrography That the yeast-derived PCV2 Cap protein self-assembles into virus-like particles (VLPs) are morphologically and antigenically That similar to insect cell-derived VLPs. Feeding raw container containing yeast extract to mice elicited Cap protein and fecal Both Serum--specific antibodies against the antigen. These results show it is feasible to That use S. cerevisiae as a safe and simple system to produce PCV2 virus-like particles, and That oral yeast-mediated antigen delivery is an alternative strategy to induce anti-PCV2 Efficiently antibodies in a mouse model, Which is worthy of further investigation in swine. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Its physio-pathology is poorly Understood and MOST of the knowledge has-been related to the inflammatory component. The aim of This work was to evaluate- gene expression profiling in fractions enriched in epithelial cells from salivary glands lip (LSGS) of Patients With primary SS and identification identify chromosomal regions harboring susceptibility genes in epithelial cells Expressed. A combined approach of gene expression and genome-wide association study was used. Enriched epithelial cell fractions Were Obtained from LSGS of Patients and controls. Amplified total RNA was labeled and hybridized to cDNA microarrays 10K. Results Were normalized and subjected to statistical analysis and functional. A genome-wide screen at 10 cM microsatellite resolution (393 markers) was performed. In salivary gland epithelial cells from Patients-528 genes differentially Were Expressed in comparison to controls. Pathways not linked to disease Were Previously found to be altered. Twenty-eight and 15 genes associated apoptosis Were With up-regulated and down regulated, respectively. Interferon-related genes, most of it Which participated in interferon signaling, Were Also found to be up-regulated. From the genome-wide screen, 6 markers Showed evidence of highly significant association with the disease. Of these, five loci harbor genes differentially Expressed In Patients LSG-epithelial cells. Our results show That in Enriched gland-epithelial cells of pSS, pro-apoptotic Both / anti-apoptotic and interferon signaling inhibition / stimulation May Occur balances. Expressed Genes found in over-epithelial cells are candidates for disease susceptibility. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

831;3436;Desired immune response characteristics in an RSV vaccine: What infants tell us;Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) Represents an Important target for vaccine development. The design of an effective vaccine for infants is hindered by a lack of knowledge of the nature of the protective immune response to RSV infection in esta age group. To Understand Mechanisms in the infant immune lung, we Examined respiratory samples from infants 0-6 months severe RSV LRI With, and Compared to uninfected These infants. At the peak of RSV infection (but not in controls), macrophages activated (CD14 +, CD16 +, CD68 +) and B lymphocytes (CD20 +, IgA +, IgM + IgG +) are prominent while dendritic cells (MHCII +) T lymphocytes and T cell associated cytokines (Welliver et al, 2007 J. Infect Dis., 195:. 1126) are not. In nasopharyngeal secretions, polyreactive IgG, IgM and IgA RSV virions Recognizing and apoptotic debris Readily Were detected. The presence of the local polyspecific antibodies strongly correlated expression of BAFF With mucosal, to T-independent B-cell activating cytokine, Which localized in lung tissue to RSV-infected respiratory epithelium and apoptotic. Local polyspecific antibodies Were Associated With better oxygenation at presentation. In vitro, products of RSV infected epithelium, BAFF: such as, TLR7 ligand, and type I IFN synergistically cytokine production and Ig elicited from cultured B lymphocytes, while virions alone ADH no such effect. Our data Suggest That in infants, innate immune factors released from RSV infected epithelium elicit T independent, polyspecific B cell responses Which Have modest protective effects. Perhaps the lack of antigen presentation via dendritic cells in infant respiratory tissue impedes the development of T-dependent responses and Contributes to severe disease susceptibility In This age group. RSV vaccine strategies tailored for infants and mature Should recruit macrophages and lung-associated dendritic cells, in order to deliver antigen to elicit long-lasting, T-cell dependent immunity. Alternatively, an RSV vaccine That Promotes Local innate B lymphocyte responses Might elicit short-term protection, bridging the gap Between maternal antibody protection and the development of mature immune responses found in older children. © 2009.;Procedia in Vaccinology;2009;Artículo;Inmunology;0;rsv;infant;infect;immun;respons;infect;100;7;0.0221827861579414;9;8;9;8;13;33

There is no approved vaccine for STEC infection in humans, and antibiotic use is contraindicated, as it Promotes Shiga toxin production. In order to identify identity STEC-associated antigens and immunogenic proteins, membrane proteins outer (OMPs) from STEC O26 Were Extracted: H11, O103, O113: H21, and O157: H7 strains, and commensal E. coli strain was used as HS control . SDS-PAGE, two-dimensional-PAGE analysis, Western blot assays using will be from pediatric HUS Patients and controls, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-tandem time of flight analyzes Were used to identify identity 12 immunogenic OMPs, some of Which Were not reactive With control will be. Importantly, seven of These Proteins Have not Been Previously Reported to be immunogenic in STEC strains. Among These seven proteins, OmpT and IgG and IgA Cah displayed reactivity With HUS will be from patients. These two genes encoding proteins Were present in a majority of STEC strains.

833;3627;Aberrant localization of fusion receptors involved in regulated exocytosis in salivary glands of Sjogren's syndrome patients is linked to ectopic mucin secretion;Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease That Affects mainly tear and salivary glands, whereby SS-Patients complain of eye and Frequently mouth dryness. Salivary acinar cells of SS-display Patients Alterations in Their cell polarity Which May Affect the correct localization and function of proteins in regulated exocytosis Involved. Here we determined to the expression and localization Whether of SNARE proteins (membrane receptors fusion) Involved in regulated secretion, VAMP8: such as, syntaxin 3 (STX3) STX4 and SNAP-23 Were altered in salivary glands (SG) from SS-patients. Additionally, we Investigated SNARE proteins function, by Evaluating Their ability to form complexes under basal conditions SNARE. In SG-SS from Control subjects Patients and mRNA levels of proteins and SNARE complex components Were Determined by Real-Time PCR and Western blotting, respectively. SNARE protein distribution and mucin exocytosis by indirect immunofluorescence Were Determined. In SS-Patients, the expression levels of mRNA and protein for VAMP8, STX4 and STX3 Were altered. STX4, STX3, SNAP-23 and VAMP8 relocated from the apical to the basal region of acinar cells. Increased formation of SNARE complexes in a manner independent of external stimuli for secretion was detected. Mucins Were detected in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Presence of mucins in the ECM, Together with the SNARE protein Observed Alterations in localization is indicative of ectopic exocytosis. In the context of SS, Such aberrantly localized mucins are likely to favor pro-inflammatory response, Which May Represent an Important step in the initial pathogenesis of esta disease. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.;JOURNAL OF AUTOIMMUNITY;2012;Artículo;Inmunology;0;protein;snare;stx;alter;local;protein;107;5;0.0237355811889973;12;6;12;6;9;4
834;3696;Melanoma cell lysate induces CCR7 expression and in vivo migration to draining lymph nodes of therapeutic human dendritic cells;Summary: We Have Previously Reported a novel method for the production of tumor-antigen-presenting cells (referred to as TAPCells) That are Currently being used in cancer therapy, using an allogeneic melanoma-derived cell lysate (referred to as Trimel) as an antigen provider and activation factor. It was recently Demonstrated That TAPCell-based immunotherapy induces T-cell-mediated immune responses RESULTING in improved long-term survival of stage IV melanoma patients. Clinically, dendritic cell (DC) migration from injected sites to lymph nodes is an Important requirement for an effective anti-tumor immunization. This mobilization of DCs is mainly driven by the C-C chemokine receptor type 7 (CCR7), Which is up-regulated on mature DCs. Using flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry, we Investigated if Trimel was capable of inducing the expression of the CCR7 on TAPCells and Enhancing Their migration in vitro, as well as in vivo Their relocation to lymph nodes in an ectopic xenograft model animals. Our results confirmed That Trimel to phenotypic maturation and induces the expression of surface Increases CCR7 on melanoma patient-derived DCs, and Also on the monocytic / macrophage cell line THP-1. , Moreover, in vitro assays Showed That Trimel-stimulated DCs and THP-1 cells Were capable of migrating in the presence Specifically CCR7 ligand CCL19 of the. Finally, we Demonstrated That Could TAPCells in vivo migrate from the injection site into the draining lymph nodes. This work Contributes to an Increased understanding of the biology of DCs produced ex vivo Allowing the design of new strategies for effective DC-based vaccines for treating aggressive melanomas. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.;IMMUNOLOGY;2014;Artículo;Inmunology;0;dcs;ccr;melanoma;migrat;tapcel;;0;0;0;1;6;7;8;13;27
835;3932;Lateral Flow Immunoassay for Diagnosis of Trypanosoma cruzi Infection with High Correlation to the Radioimmunoprecipitation Assay;"The incidence of blood donors seropositive for Trypanosoma cruzi in North America has Increased migration and population With more rigorous surveillance. The United States, for T. cruzi nonendemic Considered, THEREFORE Could be at risk to exposure to blood or parasite transmission through organ donations. Current tests show varying reactivity, especially Central American With sera. Here we describe the development of a lateral flow immunoassay for the rapid detection of T. cruzi infection has a strong correlation That to the radioim-munoprecipitation assay (RIPA) \gold standard\"" in the United States. Such a test Could have utility in small blood banks for prescreening Donors, as well as in cardiac transplantation evaluation. T. cruzi consensus and / or RIPA-positive will be from Central and South America in enzyme immunoassays Were EVALUATED (EIAs). These included commercial panels from Boston Biomedica, Inc.

836;4058;Lipopolysaccharide Inhibits the Channel Activity of the P2X7 Receptor;The purinergic P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) plays an Important role During the immune response, participating in events: such as Several cytokine release, apoptosis, and necrosis. The bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is one of the strongest stimuli of the immune response, and it has-been shown That P2X7R activation can modulate LPS-induced responses. , Moreover, a C-terminal binding site for LPS Has Been Proposed. In order to evaluate- if LPS can modulate the activity Directly of the P2X7R, we tested Several signaling pathways associated P2X7R activation in HEK293 With cells do not express the That TLR-4 receptor. We found That LPS alone was unable to induce any P2X7R-related activity, suggesting the P2X7R That is not activated by the endotoxin Directly. On the other hand, preapplication of LPS inhibited ATP-induced currents, Increase intracellular calcium, and ethidium bromide uptake and HAD no effect on ERK activation in HEK293 cells. In splenocytes-derived T-regulatory cells, in Which ATP-induced apoptosis is driven by the P2X7R ATP inhibited LPS-induced apoptosis. Altogether, These results Demonstrate That LPS modulates the activity of the P2X7R esta effect and suggest That Could be of physiological relevance.

837;4340;Trypanosoma cruzi calreticulin: A possible role in Chagas' disease autoimmunity;Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) is the causative agent of Chagas' disease, an endemic and chronic illness Affects 18 million people That in Latin America. The ITS Mechanisms underlying pathogenesis are controversial. There is a growing body of evidence supporting the view That T. cruzi infection elicits severe autoimmune responses in the host, Which Contribute Significantly to the pathogenesis of Chagas' disease, and recent studies Several Have Reported the presence of autoantibodies and effector T lymphocytes against parasite and self antigens in infected Patients infected animals and experimentally. T. cruzi calreticulin (TcCRT) is a 45 kDa protein, immunogenic in humans, rabbits and mice. It has a high degree of homology With human (HuCRT) and mouse calreticulin (MoCRT) Which would Explain why an immune response to TcCRT Could Contribute to autoimmune reactions in Chagas' disease. Anti-TcCRT antibodies generated in A / J mice Immunized With Recombinant TcCRT (rTcCRT) Reacted With rHuCRT and bound to neonatal and adult cardiomyocytes isogenic cultured in vitro. Interestingly, histological Alterations,: such as edema formation and cell infiltrates, Which include CD3 + cells, Were detected in heart sections from Immunized animals. THEREFORE, in rTcCRT-Immunized mice, an autoimmune reaction against host CRT, paralleled by histological Alterations cardiac, Suggests a Role of the parasite molecule in the induction of immunologically mediated damage heart tissue.

838;4341;Molecular mechanisms involved in the inactivation of the first component of human complement by Trypanosoma cruzi calreticulin;Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi), the agent of Chagas' disease, the sixth Most Important tropical disease worldwide neglected, causes 50,000 deaths per year in Latin America. T. cruzi calreticulin (TcCRT), a pleiotropic molecule highly chaperone, plays roles in Important Several host / parasite interactions. Among other functions, We Have That TcCRT with previously shown, translocated from the endoplasmic reticulum to the area of <U+200B><U+200B>flagellar emergence, binds human C1q and Inhibits activation of the classical pathway in vitro. Based on a series of in vitro experiments, we propose here two Mechanisms to Explain how TcCRT Inhibits the classical pathway at the initial stages of C1 (q, r, s) activation. First, TcCRT interacts in vitro With Both solid phase bound active C1s and C1, C4 but impairment of capacity is evident only activating the serine proteases are When Within the context of the macromolecular structural component first. C1s activity, Although, in esta context, is inhibited by TcCRT, the Serine Protease is not displaced from the C1 complex. Second, TcCRT C1 Prevents formation, by interfering With the ability of the (C1r-C1s) 2 tetramer to bind C1q. These inhibitory effects are better complement Explained by direct interaction of the parasite protein With C1, rather than by the TcCRT capacity to bind calcium, an essential element for the functional integrity of C1. © 2 Elsevier Ltd.;MOLECULAR IMMUNOLOGY;2010;Artículo;Inmunology;0;tccrt;bind;cruzi;inhibit;interact;;0;0;0;6;4;17;8;5;10
839;4342;Trypanosoma cruzi carrying a monoallelic deletion of the calreticulin (TcCRT) gene are susceptible to complement mediated killing and defective in their metacyclogenesis;Trypanosoma cruzi calreticulin (TcCRT) can hijack complement C1, mannan-binding lectin and ficolins from serum THUS inhibiting the classical and lectin complement pathway activation respectively. To Understand the in vivo biological functions of TcCRT in T. cruzi we generated a clonal cell line TcCRT lacking one allele (TcCRT +/-) and another clone overexpressing it (TcCRT +). Both clones Were derived from the T. cruzi strain TCC. As expected, TcCRT +/- Epimastigotes Showed impairment on TcCRT synthesis, Whereas TcCRT + ones Showed Increased protein levels. In correlation to this, monoallelic mutant susceptible to parasites Were Significantly complement killing by the machinery. On the Contrary, TcCRT + parasites Showed higher levels of resistance to mediate killing by the classical and lectin but not the alternative pathway. The Involvement of surface TcCRT was Demonstrated in depleting C1 through restoration of activity by serum killing Addition of exogenous C1. In axenic cultures, to reduced propagation rate of TcCRT +/- parasites was Observed. , Moreover, TcCRT +/- parasites presented to reduced rate of differentiation in vitro assays. As shown by down- or upregulation of expression TcCRT esta gene play a major Seems To role in providing T. cruzi With the ability to resist complement system. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.;MOLECULAR IMMUNOLOGY;2013;Artículo;Inmunology;0;tccrt;complement;cruzi;parasit;kill;;0;0;0;6;4;17;4;5;10

Differently from T. cruzi epimastigotes, trypomastigotes are complement-resistant and infective. CRPs, t-DAF, sialic acid and lipases Explain At least part of esta resistance. In vitro, T. cruzi calreticulin (TcCRT), a chaperone molecule translocates from the ER That to the parasite surface: (a) Inhibits the human classical complement activation, by interacting With C1, (b) As a consequence, an Increase in infectivity is evident and, (c) Inhibits angiogenesis and tumor It growth. We report here TcCRT That Present binds to the L-ficolin collagenous portion, just thus inhibiting approximately between 35 and 64% of the human lectin pathway complement activation, Initiated by L-ficolin, a property not shared by H-ficolin. While L-ficolin binds to 60% of trypomastigotes and to 24% of epimastigotes, 50% of the former and 4% of the Latter display TcCRT on Their surfaces. Altogether, These data Indicate That TcCRT inhibitory receptor is a parasite for ficolins. The RESULTING Evasive activities, TcCRT Together with the capacity to inhibit C1, with a concomitant Increase in infectivity, May Represent T. cruzi strategies to inhibit arms of the Important innate immune response. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.;MOLECULAR IMMUNOLOGY;2014;Artículo;Inmunology;0;ficolin;inhibit;tccrt;cruzi;infect;infect;100;7;0.0221827861579414;6;4;17;4;5;10

This article presents the view That the principles dialogical discourse on bioethical Which is based are more inclusive than professional ethics and philosophical reflection. The distinction is advanced Between rule-guided behavior and norm-justifiable acts (substantiation and justification). The Practical Implications of good practices in the generation of valid, reliable, generalizable and applicable knowledge are emphasized. For practitioners and Researchers, the need to Reflect on the Distinction Between patient and research participant can avoid the therapeutic misunderstanding, a form of abuse of the physician-patient relationship. In Addition, in resource-poor settings, the dilemma presented by the know-do gap (inapplicability of research results due to financial or social constraints) is part of the ethics' realm of the profession. Future prospects include a wider use of research results in practice, but avoidance of the know-do gap (the disparity Between what is Known and what can be done, Particularly in settings With limited resources) requires a synthetic and holistic approach to medical ethics, combining moral reflection, theoretical analysis and empirical data. © 2 by S.

809;3390;The improper use of research placebos;Reasons Given the rationale for routine use of placebos in clinical research Phase III are not convincing. Ethically Inadequate strategies: such as using placebos and recruiting the mentally incompetent for non-therapeutic research are permissible Allegedly Because research is purportedly Aimed at benefiting the common weal. Method and results A review of current literature Concludes That placebos are not equivalent to inactive substances, as amply shown has-been in clinical use in research settings whos They May be harmful, for Patients Recruited as research subjects That Often Develop expectations are all the more frustrated if They receive control substance is not therapeutic but That May show unexpected side effects. Supposedly Inert Substances Control With Have met strong opposition, for Patients are at risk of becoming Placed therapeutic orphans When Their current medication is withdrawn and 50% They have a chance of being randomized to the control arm inactive. Using placebos, it is Claimed, Increase the internal validity of a study, But This concern Appears When scant attention to misplaced external validity is Given. Conclusions, Although rejected by many Investigators and disregarded, it is an accepted practice That Should Control groups receive the best treatment in existence, not what is available locally nor a placebo. Inactive comparators Should be used only When no effective medications for the disease exists under scrutiny. Should be wary Bioethics of the tenuous justifications presented, as rarely resort to placebos Researchers in Their Own Countries sponsor, while endorsing them in Actively Third World nations Where MOST of Their trials are being located. © 2 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.;JOURNAL OF EVALUATION IN CLINICAL PRACTICE;2010;Artículo;Medical ethics;0;placebo;research;inact;substanc;therapeut;;0;0;0;14;1;14;1;27;1
810;3881;A comparative analysis of biomedical research ethics regulation systems in Europe and Latin America with regard to the protection of human subjects;The European project European and Latin American Systems of Ethics Regulation of Biomedical Research Project (EULABOR) have Carried out the first comparative analysis of ethics regulation systems for biomedical research in Seven Countries in Europe and Latin America, Evaluating Their roles in the protection of human subjects . We developed a conceptual and methodological framework defining 'ethics regulation system for biomedical research' as <U+200B><U+200B>a set of actors, Institutions, codes and laws Involved in overseeing the ethics of biomedical research on humans. This framework allowed us to Develop comprehensive national reports by conducting semi-structured interviews to key Informants. These reports Were summarised and analysed in a comparative analysis. The Study Showed That the regulatory framework for clinical research in These Countries differ in scope. It Showed That DESPITE the different political contexts, actors and motivations for creating Involved the regulation, in MOST of the Countries Studied it was the government Who Took the lead in setting up the system. The Study Also Showed That Europe and Latin America are similarly Regarding National Bodies and Research Ethics Committees, but the Brazilian system has strong specificities and noteworthy.;JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS;2010;Artículo;Medical ethics;0;research;ethic;system;biomed;regul;;0;0;0;14;1;14;1;27;1

777;223;Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase interacts with the glucocorticoid receptor upon TLR2 activation;Airway inflammation is a common condition Where glucocorticoids (GC) are a well-established therapy. It Has Been Demonstrated That Stimulate GC components of innate immunity. Specifically, GC up-Regulate TLR2 expression and activation upon inflammatory stimuli however, little is Known About the Involved In This signaling process. To determine the mechanism by Which modulates TLR2 dexamethasone-induced cytokine production was esta signaling pathway Monitored in a lung epithelial cell line exposed to the synthetic TLR2 agonist Pam 3-Cys-Ser-Lys 4. These experiments Demonstrate That phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K) is critical for the TLR2 downstream effects of GC. Cells expressing mutant PI3K (p85-dominant negative, DN p85 <U+0394>478-511) and exposed to Pam 3 -Cys-Ser-Lys 4 in the presence or absence of dexamethasone, Showed tumor necrosis factor enhanced (TNF) a expression while AP -1 and NF-kB transcriptional activity Were repressed. We experimental evidence That Provide PI3K physically interacts With the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) through two putative consensus PI3K recruitment YxxM motifs in the GR binding, suggesting some functions regulated by That esta receptor kinase Might Occur through interaction. Mutations of two tyrosine residues in the GR, 598 and 663, to phenylalanine Significantly reduced interaction With PI3K and the GC effects on TLR2-induced TNF-a expression. However, mutations did not alter These GR transcriptional activity nor cellular localization Affect of the mutant GR Expressed in COS-1 cells. THEREFORE, the PI3K-GR May Contribute to the interaction effects of GC on the TLR2 pro-inflammatory signaling cascade, THUS defining a novel signaling mechanism with a profound impact on innate immune responses. © 2011 The Authors Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine © 2011 Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine / Blackwell Publishing Ltd.;JOURNAL OF CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR MEDICINE;2011;Artículo;Medicinal chemistry;0;pik;tlr;interact;signal;cellular;;0;0;0;5;5;5;8;16;4
778;369;ATP Released by Electrical Stimuli Elicits Calcium Transients and Gene Expression in Skeletal Muscle;ATP released from cells is Known to activate plasma membrane P2X (ionotropic) or P2Y (metabotropic) receptors. In skeletal muscle cells, depolarizing stimuli induce a fast signal Both calcium and contraction associated With a slow signal That Regulates gene expression. Here we show released to the nucleotides That extracellular medium by electrical stimulation are partly Involved in the fast component and are Largely responsible for the slow signals. In rat skeletal myotubes, to tetanic stimulus (45 Hz, 400 1-ms pulses) Rapidly Increased levels of extracellular ATP, ADP, AMP and after 15 s to 3 min. Exogenous ATP induced an Increase in intracellular free Ca2 + concentration, with an EC50 value of 7.8 ± 3.1 uM. Exogenous ADP, UTP, and UDP Also Promoted calcium transients. Both fast and slow calcium signals evoked by tetanic stimulation inhibited by Were Either or 100 uM suramin 2 units / ml apyrase. Also apyrase fast and slow reduced calcium signals evoked by tetanus (45 Hz, 400-ms pulses 0.3) in isolated adult mouse skeletal fibers. A likely candidate for the ATP release pathway is the pannexin-1 hemichannel Both calcium blockers ITS inhibited ATP release and transients. The dihydropyridine receptor co-precipitated With Both the P2Y2 receptor and pannexin-1. As Reported with previously for electrical stimulation, 500 uM ATP Significantly Increased mRNA expression for Both c-fos and interleukin 6. Our results Suggest That nucleotides released During skeletal muscle activity through pannexin-1 hemichannels act through P2X and P2Y receptors to modulate Both Ca2 + homeostasis and muscle physiology. © 2009 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.;JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY;2009;Artículo;Medicinal chemistry;0;atp;calcium;releas;signal;fast;;0;0;0;5;5;5;9;11;12
779;520;Extending the models for iron and sulfur oxidation in the extreme Acidophile Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans;Background: Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans gains energy from the oxidation of ferrous iron and inorganic sulfur compounds various reduced at very acidic pH. , Although an initial model for the electron pathways Involved in iron oxidation has-been developed, much less is Known About the sulfur oxidation In This microorganism. In Addition, what Has Been Reported for Both iron and sulfur oxidation has-been derived from A. ferrooxidans different strains, some of Which Have not Been Characterized phylogenetically and some Have Been shown to be mixed cultures. It is Necessary to Provide models of iron and sulfur oxidation pathways Within one strain of A. ferrooxidans in order to comprehend the full metabolic potential of the pangenome of the genus. Results: Bioinformatic-based reconstruction supported by metabolic profiling microarray transcript and quantitative RT-PCR analysis predicts the Involvement of a number of novel genes Involved in iron and sulfur oxidation in A. ferrooxidans ATCC23270. These include for iron oxidation: cup (copper oxidase-like), ctaABT (heme biogenesis and insertion), NUOI and Nuok (NADH complex subunits), sdrA1 (NADH complex accessory protein) and atpB and atpE (ATP synthetase F0 subunits). The following new genes are Predicted to be Involved in reduced inorganic sulfur compounds oxidation: a gene cluster (RHD, corncob, dsrE, HDRC, HDRB, hdrA, orf2, HDRC, HDRB) encoding three sulfurtransferases and a reductase heterodisulfide complex, sat Potentially encoding an ATP sulfurylase and sdrA2 (an accessory subunit NADH complex). Two different regulatory components are Predicted to be Involved in the regulation of alternate electron transfer pathways: 1) a gene cluster (ctaRUS) That contains a Predicted iron responsive regulator of the Rrf2 Family That is hypothesized to Regulate cytochrome aa3oxidase biogenesis and 2) to two component sensor-regulator of the RegB-RegA Family That May Respond to the redox state of the quinone pool. Conclusion: Bioinformatic analysis coupled With gene transcript profiling extends our understanding of the iron and inorganic sulfur compounds reduced oxidation pathways in A. ferrooxidans and Suggests Mechanisms for Their regulation. The models Provide unified and coherent descriptions of These Processes Within the type strain, Eliminating ambiguity previous models built from Caused by analyzes of multiple and divergent strains of microorganism esta. © 2009 Quatrini et al licensee BioMed Central Ltd.;BMC GENOMICS;2009;Artículo;Medicinal chemistry;0;oxid;iron;sulfur;ferrooxidan;gene;gene;102;6;0.0226264418811003;2;5;2;4;9;44
780;1267;Protein Carbonylation and Adipocyte Mitochondrial Function;Carbonylation is the covalent, non-reversible modification of the side chains of cysteine, histidine, and lysine residues lipid peroxidation by end products as 4-hydroxy- Such and 4-oxononenal. In adipose tissue the effects of Modifications Such are associated oxidative stress With Increased metabolic dysregulation and mitochondrial energy metabolism centered on. To address the role of protein carbonylation in the pathogenesis of mitochondrial dysfunction, quantitative proteomics was employed to identify identity specific targets of carbonylation in Gsta4-silenced or overexpressing 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Gsta4-silenced adipocytes displayed elevated carbonylation of Several key mitochondrial proteins Including the phosphate carrier protein, NADH dehydrogenase 1a subcomplexes 2 and 3, translocase of inner mitochondrial membrane 50, and Valyl-tRNA synthetase. Elevated protein carbonylation is diminished Accompanied by complex I activity, impaired respiration, Increased superoxide production, and a reduction in membrane potential without changes in mitochondrial number, area, or density. Silencing of the carrier or phosphate dehydrogenase NADH 1a subcomplexes 2 or 3 in 3T3-L1 cells results in basal and maximal respiration Decreased. These results Suggest That plays a major protein carbonylation instigating role in cytokine-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction and may be linked to the development of insulin resistance in the adipocyte. © 2012 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.;JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY;2012;Artículo;Medicinal chemistry;0;carbonyl;mitochondri;protein;adipocyt;silenc;protein;107;5;0.0237355811889973;5;5;5;9;17;12
781;1271;Mitochondrial fission is required for cardiomyocyte hypertrophy mediated by a Ca2+-calcineurin signaling pathway;Cardiomyocyte hypertrophy Has Been Associated With diminished mitochondrial metabolism. Mitochondria are organelles crucial for the production of ATP, and Their morphology and function are regulated by the Dynamic Processes of fusion and fission. The Relationship Between Mitochondrial Dynamics and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy is still poorly Understood. Here, we show treatment of neonatal That cultured rat cardiomyocytes With the hypertrophic agonist norepinephrine Promotes mitochondrial fission (Characterized by a decrease in mitochondrial volume and mean an Increase in the relative number of mitochondria per cell) and a decrease in mitochondrial function. We Demonstrate That norepinephrine acts through a1-adrenergic receptors to Increase cytoplasmic Ca2 +, activating calcineurin and Promoting migration of the fission protein Drp1 (encoded by Dnml1) to mitochondria. Dominant-negative Drp1 (K38A) not only preventer mitochondrial fission, it blocked hypertrophic growth of Present cardiomyocytes in response to norepinephrine. Remarkably, an antisense adenovirus Mfn2 against the fusion protein (AsMfn2) was sufficient to Increase Mitochondrial Fission and Stimulate a hypertrophic response without agonist treatment. Collectively, These results Demonstrate the Importance of mitochondrial dynamics in the development of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and metabolic remodeling. © 2014.

784;2032;Key Proteins in the Polyamine-Trypanothione Pathway as Drug Targets Against Trypanosoma cruzi;In trypanosomatids, redox homeostasis is centered on trypanothione (N1, N8-bis (glutathionyl) spermidine, T (SH) 2) molecular weight to low That is distinctive for thiol esta taxonomic family and not present in the mammalian host. THUS, the study of the metabolism of T (SH) 2 is interesting as a potential therapeutic target. In This review, we summarize the evidence Existing About the metabolism of thiols in Trypanosoma cruzi, focused on That can be proteins Those Considered the best candidates for selective therapy. Herein, we examine the biosynthetic pathway of T (SH) 2, Identifying three key points That are susceptible to attack pharmacologically: the activity of the trypanothione reductase (TR), the function of glutamate-cysteine <U+200B><U+200B>ligase (GCL) and polyamine transport in T . cruzi. TR Has Been Widely Studied and is a good example for the development of the medicinal chemistry of antichagasic compounds. Conversely, GCL and the polyamine uptake system are high flow points in the reductive metabolism of the parasite. However, very little is Known at the molecular level acerca These two systems. THEREFORE, Their potential as targets for drug development is Discussed, and it is Suggested That Should research focus on the production of alternative drugs for Chagas' disease treatment. © 2014 Bentham Science Publishers.;CURRENT MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY;2014;Artículo;Medicinal chemistry;0;metabol;cruzi;develop;drug;focus;develop;57;13;0.0126441881100266;6;4;17;8;5;2
785;2043;Increased ER-mitochondrial coupling promotes mitochondrial respiration and bioenergetics during early phases of ER stress;Increasing evidence Indicates That endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress activates the unfolded protein response adaptive (UPR), but That beyond a certain degree of damage ER, triggers apoptotic pathways esta response. The General Mechanisms of the UPR and Its apoptotic pathways are well Characterized. However, the metabolic events That Occur During the adaptive phase of ER stress, before the cell death response, REMAIN unknown. Here, we show That, During the onset of ER stress, the reticular and mitochondrial networks are redistributed towards the perinuclear area and Their points of connection are Increased in a microtubule-dependent fashion. A localized Increase in mitochondrial transmembrane potential is Observed only in redistributed mitochondria, mitochondria Whereas in other subcellular That Remain zones display no significant changes. Spatial re-organization of These organelles correlates With An Increase in ATP levels, oxygen consumption, and power reductive Increased mitochondrial Ca 2+ uptake. Accordingly, uncoupling of the organelles or Ca 2+ blocking the transfer impaired metabolic response, rendering cells vulnerable to more ER stress. Overall, These data Indicate That an early ER stress induces mitochondrial metabolism Increase in That depends crucially upon coupling and Ca2 + organelle transfer, Which, by cellular bioenergetics Enhancing, Establishes the metabolic basis for the adaptation to this response. © 2011.

788;2676;Hydrogen Peroxide Removes TRPM4 Current Desensitization Conferring Increased Vulnerability to Necrotic Cell Death;Necrosis is associated With An Increase in plasma membrane permeability, cell swelling, and loss of membrane integrity With subsequent release of cytoplasmic Constituents. Severe redox imbalance by overproduction of reactive oxygen species is one of the main causes of necrosis. Here we Demonstrate That H2O2 induces a sustained activity of TRPM4, a Ca 2+ -activated, Ca2 + -impermeant nonselective cation channel in an RESULTING Increased vulnerability to cell death. In HEK 293 cells overexpressing TRPM4, H2O2 was found to remove as in a dose-dependent manner TRPM4 desensitization. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments revealed Cys1093 That the residue is crucial for the H2O2-mediated loss of desensitization. In HeLa cells, endogenously express Which TRPM4, H2O2 elicited apoptosis as well as necrosis. H2O2-mediated apoptosis but not necrosis was abolished by replacement of external Na + ions or sucrose With the non-permeant cation N-methyl-D-glucamine and by knocking down TRPM4 with a shRNA directed against TRPM4. Conversely, transient overexpression in HeLa cells of TRPM4 in Which TRPM4 was re-established with previously silenced vulnerability to H2O2-induced necrotic cell death.

794;3631;NADPH Oxidase and Hydrogen Peroxide Mediate Insulin-induced Calcium Increase in Skeletal Muscle Cells;Skeletal muscle is one of the main physiological targets of insulin, a hormone That triggers a complex signaling cascade and the production of That Enhances reactive oxygen species (ROS) in different cell types. ROS, second messengers Currently Considered produces redox Modifications in proteins: such as ion channels That induces changes in Their functional properties. In myotubes, insulin release from calcium Enhances Present intracellular stores. In This work, we Studied in myotubes stimulated ROS production Whether insulin and Investigated the Mechanisms underlying the insulin-dependent calcium Increase: in particular the late phase of Whether the Ca2 + induced by insulin required Increase ROS. We found insulin stimulated ROS production That, as detected With the probe 2 ', 7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (CM-H2DCFDA). We used the translocation of p47 from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane as a marker of the activation of NADPH oxidase. Insulin-stimulated ROS generation was suppressed by the NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin and by small interfering RNA against p47, a NADPH oxidase subunit regulatory. Additionally, protein kinase C and Both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in insulin are presumably Involved-induced ROS generation Because bisindolylmaleimide, a nonspecific protein kinase C inhibitor, and LY290042, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, inhibited esta increase. Bisindolylmaleimide, LY290042, apocynin, small interfering RNA against p47, and two drugs interfere That inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate With mediated Ca2 + release-, xestospongin C and U73122, inhibited the intracellular Ca2 + Increase produced by insulin. These combined results strongly induces insulin Suggest That ROS generation Trough NADPH activation and ROS esta That Increase is required for the intracellular Ca2 + mediated by inositol 1,4,5 rise-trisphosphate receptors. © 2009 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.;JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY;2009;Artículo;Medicinal chemistry;0;insulin;ros;induc;kinas;nadph;induc;54;14;0.0119787045252884;5;5;5;9;11;12

We explored These pharmacologic and molecular Mechanisms using perturbations of genetically engineered (dyspedic) muscle cells constitutively That lack expression of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2 skeletal muscle + release channels, R and R1 and RyR3. We Demonstrate that expression of R and R1 here is responsible for more than half of the total resting Ca2 concentration ([Ca2 +] rest) Measured in wild type cells. The elevated [Ca2 +] rest in RyR1-expressing cells is not a result of active gating of the RyR1 channel but is Accounted for by Instead the RyR1 ryanodine-insensitive Ca2 + leak conformation. In Addition, we Demonstrate That sarcolemmal Ca2 + Influx basal Also Governed by R and R1 is expression and Contributes in the regulation of [Ca2 +] in skeletal myotubes rest. © 2 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.;JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY;2010;Artículo;Medicinal chemistry;0;rest;ryr;channel;muscl;skelet;;0;0;0;5;5;5;9;11;24
796;3914;Morphologic and immunohistochemical organization of the human habenular complex;The habenular complex (HbCpx) is a phylogenetically conserved brain structure located in the epithalamus of Vertebrates. DESPITE ITS crucial role in decision-making Processes and the Proposed link Between habenular dysfunction and neuropsychiatric conditions, little is Known About the structural and functional organization of the HbCpx in humans. The goal of esta THUS study was to Provide a first systematic morphologic and immunohistochemical analysis of the human HbCpx to begin dissecting nuclear its and subnuclear organization. Our results confirmed the human HbCpx That is subdivided into medial (MHb) and lateral (LHB) nuclei, each showing a large degree of intranuclear morphologic heterogeneity. Analysis of serially stained sections using a combination of morphologic and immunohistochemical criteria allowed the distinction of five subnuclei in Both the MHb and LHB. Overall, the organization of the subnuclear Observed in humans MHb Resembles the organization of subnuclei in the MHb of rats. The shape, size relative, and intranuclear organization of the LHB, however, show significant Differences. The contribution of the LHB to the Entire HbCpx About five times larger is in humans than in rats. Noteworthy, a dorsal domain of the LHB myelinated afferent fibers That contains stria medullaris and from the GABA B-R shows 1 immunoreactive cells, enlarged in humans Substantially Appears When Compared To rats. This feature Seems to account for a large part of the relative growth in size of the LHB in humans and opens the intriguing Possibility of an Increased influence of limbic and striatal afferents into the LHB of humans. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.;JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE NEUROLOGY;2011;Artículo;Medicinal chemistry;0;human;lhb;hbcpx;organ;mhb;;0;0;0;12;6;12;6;29;16

DESPITE the established role of the HBP in metabolism and multiple diseases, regulation of the HBP remains undefined Largely. Here, we show That spliced <U+200B><U+200B>X-box binding protein 1 (Xbp1s) The most conserved signal transducer of the unfolded protein response (UPR) is a direct transcriptional activator of the HBP. We Demonstrate That the UPR triggers activation via HBP Xbp1s-dependent transcription of genes coding for key, rate-limiting enzymes. We further Establish That esta Previously Unrecognized UPR-axis HBP is triggered in a variety of stress conditions. Finally, we Demonstrate a physiologic role for the UPR-HBP axis by showing That acute stimulation of Xbp1s in heart by ischemia / reperfusion Confers robust cardioprotection in part through induction of the HBP. Collectively, These studies reveal That Xbp1s couples the UPR to the HBP to protect cells under stress. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.;CELL;2014;Artículo;Medicinal chemistry;0;hbp;upr;xbps;glcnac;protein;protein;107;5;0.0237355811889973;5;5;5;8;11;4
798;3939;The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor regulates autophagy through its interaction with Beclin 1;Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate The receptor (IP 3 R) is a major regulator of apoptotic signaling. Through interactions With members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins, it drives calcium (Ca2 +) transients from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to mitochondria, thereby Establishing a functional and physical link Between These organelles. Importantly, the IP3R Also Regulates autophagy, and in particular its Inhibition / macroautophagy strongly induces depletion. Here, we show the IP3R That xestospongin B antagonist induces autophagy by disrupting molecular complex FORMED by the IP3 R and Beclin 1, an interaction That is inhibited by overexpression or Increased or knockdown of Bcl-2, respectively. An effect of Beclin 1 on Ca2 + homeostasis was discarded as siRNA-mediated knockdown of Beclin 1 did not Affect cytosolic or luminal ER Ca2 + levels. Xestospongin B- or autophagy starvation-induced overexpression was inhibited by IP3R of the ligand-binding domain, Which coimmunoprecipitated With Beclin 1.

799;4080;Rrn7 Protein, an RNA Polymerase I Transcription Factor, Is Required for RNA Polymerase II-dependent Transcription Directed by Core Promoters with a HomolD Box Sequence;The region in the transcription specifies Promoters That is called the core machinery promoter, displaying core promoter elements (CPE) Necessary for establishment of a preinitiation complex and the initiation of transcription. A classical CPE is the TATA box. In fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, a new CPE, called HomolD box, was discovered. Collectively, 141 ribosomal protein genes encoding the full set of 79 different ribosomal proteins and more than 60 other genes housekeeping display to HomolD box in the core promoter. Here, we show directed by the transcription That HomolD box RNA polymerase II requires the machinery, Including the General transcription factors. Most intriguingly, however, we identify identity, by DNA affinity purification, Rrn7 as the protein binding to the HomolD box. Rrn7 is an evolutionary conserved member of the RNA polymerase I transcription initiation machinery Involved in ribosomal DNA of core Promoters. That shows ChIP Rrn7 cross-links to a container containing ribosomal protein gene promoter HomolD the box but not to a container containing a TATA box promoter. Taken together, our results Suggest That Rrn7 is an excellent candidate to be Involved in the coordination of ribosomal DNA and ribosomal gene transcription and synthesis During ribosome, THEREFORE, offer a new perspective to study conservation and evolvability of regulatory networks in eukaryotes. © 2011 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.;JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY;2011;Artículo;Medicinal chemistry;0;box;promot;ribosom;transcript;homold;;0;0;0;12;6;12;8;18;7

TRPV1 is a polymodal channel activated by noxious heat, capsaicin, and protons. As a sensor for noxious stimuli, TRPV1 channel has-been as a key contributor Described to pain signaling. To form a functional channel, TRPV1 subunits must assemble into tetramers, and Have Identified Several studies TRPV1 the C terminus as an essential element in subunit association. Here we combined biochemical assays and imaging electrophysiology With bimolecular fluorescence complementation-based (BiFC) and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) in live cells to identify identity to short motif in the C-terminal tail of the TRPV1 channel subunit That Governs assembly. Removing This region through early truncation or deletion results in targeted loss of subunit association and channel function. Importantly, we found That interfering With TRPV1 subunit association using a plasma membrane-tethered peptide mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity attenuated in two mouse models of inflammatory hyperalgesia.

The signaling cascade includes calcium-dependent activation of protein kinase upstream of Rho C.alpha However, what causes the intracellular calcium transients required to Promote adhesion remains unclear. P2X7 purinergic receptors are Important for astrocyte function and form non-selective cation large pores upon binding to Their ligand, ATP. THUS, we EVALUATED Whether the intracellular calcium required for Thy-1-induced cell adhesion mediated by Influx stems from ATP P2X7 receptors-activated. Results show induced by the adhesion That fusion protein Thy-1-Fc was Preceded by ATP release and sustained Both intracellular calcium elevation. Elimination of extracellular ATP With apyrase, chelation of extracellular calcium With EGTA, or inhibition of P2X7 With oxidized ATP, all individually blocked intracellular calcium Increase and Thy-1-stimulated adhesion. , Moreover, Thy-1 mutated in the integrin-binding site did not trigger ATP release, and silencing of P2X7 With specific siRNA blocked Thy-1-induced adhesion. This study is the first to Demonstrate a functional link Between avß3 integrin and P2X7 receptors, and to reveal an Important, hitherto unanticipated, role for P2X7 in calcium-dependent signaling required for Thy-1-stimulated astrocyte adhesion. © 2011.

773;3178;Pannexin 1: A novel participant in neuropathic pain signaling in the rat spinal cord;Pannexin 1 (panx1) is a large-pore membrane channel Expressed in many tissues of mammals, glial cells and neurons Including. Panx1 channels are permeable to calcium and highly adenosine triphosphatase (ATP) on the other hand, they can be opened by They ATP and glutamate, two crucial molecules for acute and chronic pain signaling in the spinal cord dorsal horn, suggesting THUS panx1 That Could be a key component for the generation of persistent pain Central sensitization During. In This study, we Examined the effect of three panx1 blockers, Namely, 10panx peptide, carbenoxolone, and probenecid, on C-reflex wind-up activity and mechanical nociceptive behavior in a spared nerve injury model rat neuropathic sural nerve transection Involving. In Addition, the expression of panx1 protein in the dorsal horn of the ipsilateral lumbar spinal cord was Measured in sural nerve-transected rats and sham-operated control. Sural nerve transection Resulted in a lower threshold for C-reflex activation by electric stimulation of the injured hindpaw, Together with persistent hypersensitivity to mechanical stimuli applied to the pressure paw. Intrathecal administration of the panx1 blockers Significantly depressed the spinal C-reflex wind-up activity in neuropathic and sham rats Both control and mechanical hyperalgesia in neuropathic Decreased rats without Affecting the nociceptive threshold in sham animals.

774;3410;Endothelial Epithelial Sodium Channel Inhibition Activates Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase via Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase/Akt in Small-Diameter Mesenteric Arteries;Recent studies Have Shown That the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is Expressed in vascular tissue. However, the ENaC That May play role in the responses to vasoconstrictors and NO production have yet to be addressed. In This study, the contractile responses of perfused pressurized small-diameter rat mesenteric arteries to phenylephrine and serotonin Were reduced by ENaC blockade With amiloride (75.1 ± 3.2% and 16.9 ± 2.3% of values <U+200B><U+200B>controlling, respectively P & lt .01) That was dose dependent (EC50 = 88.9 ± 1. 6 nmol / L). Incubation With benzamil, another ENaC blocker, ADH-like effects, a, ß, <U+03B3> and ENaC Were Identified in small-diameter rat mesenteric arteries using RT-PCR and Western blot With specific antibodies. Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization localized ENaC expression to the tunica media and endothelium of small-diameter rat mesenteric arteries. Patch-clamp experiments Demonstrated That primary cultures of mesenteric artery endothelial cells amiloride-sensitive sodium Expressed currents. Mechanical ablation of the endothelium or inhibition of eNOS With N'<U+03C9>-nitro-L- arginine inhibited the reduction in contractility Caused by ENaC blockers. ENaC inhibitors Increased eNOS phosphorylation (Ser 1177) and Akt phosphorylation (Ser 473). The presence of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 blunted Akt phosphorylation and eNOS phosphorylation and the decrease in the response to phenylephrine Caused by blockers of ENaC, indicating That the phosphoinositide 3-kinase / Akt pathway was activated after ENaC inhibition. Finally, we Observed That the effects of blockers of ENaC Were flow dependent and That the vasodilatory response to shear stress was enhanced by ENaC blockade.

635;130;Perk-dependent repression of miR-106b-25 cluster is required for ER stress-induced apoptosis;Activation of the unfolded protein response sensor PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (pERK) attenuates endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress levels. Conversantly, if the damage is too severe and ER function can not be restored, This triggers apoptosis signaling branch. Bcl-2 homology 3-only family member Bim is essential for apoptosis ER stress-induced. However, the regulatory Mechanisms controlling Bim activation under ER stress conditions are not well Understood. Here, we show That downregulation of themiR-106b-25 cluster Contributes to ER stress-induced apoptosis and the upregulation of Bim. Hypericin-mediated photo-oxidative damage induced ER Perk-dependent cell death and led to a significant decrease in the levels of miRNAs miR-106b Belonging to-25 cluster in wild-type (WT) but not in Perk - / - MEFs. Further, we show that expression of miR-106b-25 and MCM-7 (host gene of miR-106b-25) is co-regulated transcription factors through the ATF4 (Activating transcription factor 4) and Nrf2 (nuclear factorerythroid- 2-related factor 2). Increased ER stress the activity of WT Bim 30UTR (untranslated region) but not construct the miR-106b-25 recognition site-mutated Bim 30UTR construct. Overexpression of miR-106b-25 cluster Inhibits ER stress-induced cell death in WT but did not confer any further protection in Bim-knockdown cells. Further, we show downregulation in the levels of miR-106b-25 cluster in the symptomatic SOD1G86R transgenic mice.

637;210;Liver preconditioning induced by iron in a rat model of ischemia/reperfusion;Aims: Liver preconditioning against ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury is a major area of <U+200B><U+200B>experimental research, in Which regulation of gene expression due to With cytoprotective responses oxidative stress transient development Has Been Reported. Considering That significant cytoprotection OCCURS after exposure to low levels of iron (Fe), we tested the hypothesis That sub-chronic administration of Fe to oxidative stress transient rats underlying preconditions the liver against IR injury. Main methods: Animals received six doses (50 mg Fe-dextran / kg ip) every second day During 10 days, before partial IR (vascular clamping) or sham laparotomy (control). Transient oxidative stress was defined by liver glutathione and protein carbonyl contents (24, 48, and 72 h after treatment Fe). Plasma and liver Fe and ferritin status content (western blot) Were Assessed in animals not subjected to IR. Liver injury and inflammatory response by serum transaminases Were EVALUATED, liver morphology and serum TNF-a. Fe preconditioning against injury was correlated IR With liver glutathione content and the redox-sensitive NF-kB signaling pathway (EMSA) and Western blot analysis of haptoglobin. Key findings: Significant hepatoprotection against IR injury, oxidative stress and underlying transient enhancement in the Total and labile pools Fe, Fe was Achieved by administration. Abrogation of IR injury is related to TNF-a response reduced (91%), abolishment of the IR-induced liver glutathione depletion and recovery of the NF-kB signaling pathway (75%), IR During lost. Significance: Sub-chronic administration Fe Protects against the liver IR injury through antioxidant and anti-inflammatory responses, with recovery of NF-kB activation and related acute-phase response signaling. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Results: Our data show That LPS is able to induce PC12 neuronal cell death without the participation of glial cells. Neuronal cell death was mediated by an Increase in cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Considering the prevalent role of specific ion channels in mediating the deleterious effect of ROS, we Assessed Their contribution to this process. Neurons exposed to LPS Showed intracellular Ca 2+ to significant overload, and nonselective cationic channel blockers inhibited LPS-induced neuronal death. In particularly, we Observed That Both LPS and hydrogen peroxide Increased exposure strongly the expression of the transient receptor protein melastatin 7 (TRPM7), an ion channel Which is Directly Implicated in neuronal cell death. Further, Both LPS-induced neuronal TRPM7 overexpression and LPS-induced cell death Were Decreased With dithiothreitol, dipheniliodonium, and apocynin. Finally, knockdown of TRPM7 small interference RNA expression using primary hippocampal neurons protected technology and Differentiated PC12 neurons from the LPS challenge. Innovation: This is the first report showing TRPM7 That is a key protein in neuronal death after Involved LPS challenge.

640;230;Alpha linolenic acid (ALA) from Rosa canina, sacha inchi and chia oils may increase ALA accretion and its conversion into n-3 LCPUFA in diverse tissues of the rat;Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) is an essential n-3 PUFA n-3 LCPUFA ITS EPA and DHA derivatives, Which Have diverse beneficial effects, are scarce in the human diet. In recent years vegetable oils rich in nontraditional ALA (up to 45%) Have Been developed as new alternatives to Increase ALA consumption. This work EVALUATED the accretion of ALA, EPA and DHA into the phospholipids Retrieved from erythrocytes, liver, kidney, small intestine, heart, quadriceps and the brain in rats fed sunflower (SFO), canola (CO), Rosa canina (RCO) sacha inchi (Plukenetia volubilis, SIO) and chia (Salvia hispanica, CHO) oils. Five experimental groups (n = 12 per group) Were fed for 21 Days with SFO (1% ALA), CO (10% ALA), RCO (33% ALA), SIO (49% ALA), and CHO (64% ALA ). SIO and ChO allowed higher ALA accretion in all tissues, except the brain, and a reduction in the content of arachidonic acid in all tissues except the brain. EPA was Increased in erythrocytes, liver, kidney, small intestine, heart and quadriceps, but not in the brain. Increased DHA was in the liver, small intestine and brain tissues. Our results Demonstrate That ALA When provided in significant Amounts, can be converted into n-3 LCPUFA, mostly DHA in the liver and brain. It is rich in oils Suggested That ALA, Such as SIO and ChO, are good sources for Obtaining higher levels of ALA tissue, selective conversion ITS Also Allowing into n-3 LCPUFA in some tissues of the rat.

642;274;Cav1.1 controls frequency-dependent events regulating adult skeletal muscle plasticity;An Important pending question in biology is how neuromuscular skeletal muscle cells decipher the stimulation pattern coming from motoneurons to define Their phenotype as fast or slow twitch muscle fibers. We Have Previously shown That voltage-gated L-type calcium channel (Cav1.1) acts as a voltage sensor for activation of inositol (1,4,5) -trisphosphate [Ins (1,4,5) P3] -dependent Ca2 + That Regulates gene expression signals. ATP released by muscle cells after stimulation through pannexin-electrical 1 plays a key role channels in esta process. We show now That Determines frequency stimulation and release ATP Both Ins (1,4,5) P3 production in adult skeletal muscle and That Cav1.1 and pannexin-1 colocalize in the transverse tubules. Both ATP release and Increased Ins (1,4,5) P3 was seen in flexor digitorum brevis fibers stimulated With 270 pulses at 20 Hz, but not at 90 Hz. 20 Hz stimulation induced changes related to transcriptional fast-to-slow muscle fiber That transition phenotype required ATP release. Addition of 30 mM ATP to the same fibers induced transcriptional changes after Observed 20 Hz stimulation. Myotubes lacking the Cav1.1-a1 subunit after ATP released almost no electrical stimulation, showing Cav1.1 That has the central role in esta process. In adult muscle fibers, ATP release and the transcriptional changes produced by 20 Hz stimulation Were blocked by the Cav1.1 antagonist Both nifedipine (25 mM) and by the Cav1.1 agonist (-) SBayK 8644 (10 mM). We propose a new role for Cav1.1, independent of calcium channel activity ITS, in the activation of signaling pathways Allowing muscle fibers to decipher the frequency of electrical stimulation and to activate specific transcriptional programs That defines Their phenotype. © 2.

643;347;Apoptosis, necrosis and autophagy are influenced by metabolic energy sources in cultured rat spermatocytes;Apoptosis, necrosis and autophagy are mechanistically related tissue homeostasis Processes That Control and cell survival. In the testis, germ cell death is Important for controlling sperm output, but it is unknown whether or not can switch from germ cells apoptosis to necrosis, as has-been Reported in other tissues. Furthermore, autophagy has not Been Reported in spermatogenesis. Spermatocytes (meiotic cells) and spermatids (haploid cells) use lactate rather than glucose as substrate for producing Their primary ATP. The metabolism of glucose, but not lactate, you reduce ATP levels and intracellular Increases [H +] and [Ca 2+], Both of Which are associated With apoptosis and / or necrosis in somatic cells. In This work, we EVALUATED Whether different energy sources,: such as lactate or glucose, can influence spermatocyte death type and / or survival in primary cultures. Spermatocytes cultured for 12 h without an energy source died by necrosis, while spermatocytes cultured with 5 mM glucose Showed a significant Increase in apoptosis, as evidenced by caspase activity, TUNEL assay and phosphatidylserine exposure. Apoptosis was not Observed in spermatocytes cultured with 5 mM lactate or deoxyglucose.

644;414;Kinetics of hematoma expansion in murine warfarin-associated intracerebral hemorrhage;Background and Purpose: The Burden of intracerebral hemorrhage associated oral anticoagulants With (OAC-ICH) is growing. However, little is Known About the pathophysiology of W-ICH. Herein, we refine a mouse model of OAC-ICH using repetitive MRI T2 * to describe kinetics of hematoma enlargement, and Establish a Benchside point of care assay INR (PoC) for assessment of anticoagulation. Methods: C57 / BL6 mice drank warfarin (0.4 mg / kg / 24 h) in Their water. ICH was induced by stereotactic injection of collagenase type VII (0.045 U) into the left striatum. Hemorrhagic blood volume was Quantified by MRI T2 * images and on cryosections 48 h after induction ICH. Kinetics of hematoma expansion Were Compared in strongly, moderately, and non-anticoagulated mice using MRI T2 * Repeated imaging. The PoC INR technique was validated against standard laboratory INR, and tail vein bleeding time (TVBT). Results: With PoC INR correlated Central laboratory measurements (r = 0.989 p & lt 0.0001) and With TVBT (r = 0.982 p & lt 0.0001). Hematoma volume was 21.2 ± 6.7 mm3 in heavily (PoC INR 4.5), 12.3 ± 4.8 in moderately (INR 2-3), and 8.6 ± 3.3 in non-anticoagulated mice (INR & lt 1.2). Hematoma volume determined to cryosections from MRI T2 * and correlated well (r = 0.922). Strength of anticoagulation was associated With neurologic outcome. Hematoma enlargement occurred mainly During The First 3 h in anticoagulated mice. Conclusions: Allows PoC INR Benchside Repeated measurements in single MICE Which Reflect the level of anticoagulation. Stronger results in larger volumes AntiCoagulation hematoma. As hematoma enlargement mainly OCCURS During the first hours, hemostatic potential therapies Should be tested early in esta OAC-ICH model. © 2 Elsevier B.V.

645;512;Overexpression of Hyperpolarization-Activated Cyclic Nucleotide-Gated Channels into the Ventral Tegmental Area Increases the Rewarding Effects of Ethanol in UChB Drinking Rats;Background: A number of studies Have Shown That ethanol (EtOH) activates dopamine neurocircuitries and is self-administered ventral tegmental area into the (VTA) of the rat brain. In vitro and in silico studies Showed That Have hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels on VTA dopamine ionic neurons May Constitute a molecular target of EtOH however, there is no in vivo evidence supporting esta assumption. Methods: Wistar-derived University of Chile Drinking (UChB) microinjected into rats Were the VTA with a lentiviral vector coding for rat HCN-2 ionic channel or control vector. Four days after vector administration, daily intake was voluntary EtOH Assessed for 30 days under a free-access paradigm to 5% EtOH and water. After EtOH consumption studies, the effect of HCN-2 overexpression was Present Assessed on EtOH-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) EtOH-induced locomotion, and EtOH-induced dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). Results: Rats microinjected With the HCN-2 coding vector into the VTA Showed (i) ~ 2-fold Increase in Their voluntary EtOH intake Compared to Control animals, (ii) lentiviral-HCN-2-treated animals Also Showed an Increased CPP to EtOH (~ 3-fold), (iii) a significant locomotor activity higher (~ 2-fold), and (iv) Increased dopamine release in NAcc upon systemic administration of EtOH (~ 2-fold). Conclusions: Overexpression of HCN-2 ionic channel in the VTA of rats results in an Increase in voluntary EtOH intake, EtOH-induced CPP, locomotor activity, and dopamine release in NACC suggesting That HCN levels in the VTA are Relevant for the rewarding properties of EtOH. © 2014 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.;ALCOHOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH;2014;Artículo;Medicine, research & experimental;0;etoh;hcn;vta;dopamin;rat;rat;45;20;0.00998225377107365;12;6;12;8;29;31
646;574;Risk variants in BMP4 promoters for nonsyndromic cleft lip/palate in a Chilean population;Background: Bone morphogenetic protein 4 gene (BMP4) plays a key role maxillofacial During development, orofacial clefts since in animals are Observed When This gene is conditionally inactivated. We recently reported almost the existence of association Between nonsyndromic cleft lip / palate (NSCLP) and BMP4 polymorphisms by detecting deviations for transmission include a region haplotypes That BMP4 container containing a promoter in case-parent trios. The aim of the present study was to search for possible causal mutations Within BMP4 Promoters (BMP4.1 and BMP4.2) .Methods: We Analyzed the sequence of BMP4.1 and BMP4.2 in 167 cases and 336 Chilean NSCLP controls.Results : We detected three novel variants in BMP4.1 (c.-5514G> A, c.-5365C> T and C-5049C> T) Which Could Be Considered as risk factors due to cleft Their absence in controls. Additionally, rs2855530 G allele (BMP4.2) an Showed Increased risk carriers for NSCLP restricted to diseases (OR = 1.52 95% C.I. = 1.07-2.15 p = 0.019). For esta same SNP the dominant genotype model Showed a higher frequency of G / G + G / C and a lower frequency of C / C in cases than controls in the overall sample (p = 0.03) and in the male sample (p = 0.003 ). The sex-dependent models Association Between rs2855530 and NSCLP Indirectly Could be related to the differential gene expression in animals Observed Between Sexes: Bioinformatic Analysis Showed That prediction all the risk variants detected in esta study transcription factor Could create new binding motifs.Conclusions. We Concluded That risk variants detected HEREIN Could Potentially alter BMP4 promoter activity in NSCLP. Further studies are functional and developmental Necessary to Support this hypothesis. © 2011 Suazo et al licensee BioMed Central Ltd.;BMC MEDICAL GENETICS;2011;Artículo;Medicine, research & experimental;0;bmp;nsclp;risk;cleft;gene;gene;102;6;0.0226264418811003;12;6;19;4;3;9
647;621;Prednisolone has a positive effect on the kidney but not on the liver of brain dead rats: a potencial role in complement activation;Background: Contradictory evidence has-been published on the effects of steroid treatments on the outcomes of kidney and liver transplantation from brain dead (BD) Donors. Our study Aimed to Evaluate esta disparity by investigating the effect of prednisolone administration on rats.Methods BD: BD induction was performed in rats ventilated by inflating a Fogarty catheter in the epidural space Placed. Prednisolone (22.5 mg / kg) was administered 30 min prior to induction BD. After four hours of determination of BD: serum, kidney and liver tissues samples Were Collected and stored. RT-qPCR, immunohistochemistry and routine biochemistry Were performed.Results: Prednisolone treatment reduced circulating IL-6 and plasma creatinine levels but not serum AST, ALT or LDH. Influx polymorphonuclear Assessed by Histology, and inflammatory gene expression in the kidney Were reduced and liver. However, complement component 3 (C3) was Decreased expression in kidney but not in liver. Gene expression of HSP-70, a cytoprotective protein, was down-regulated in the liver after treatment.Conclusions: This study shows That Decreases prednisolone and renal inflammation Improves function, reducing liver injury Whilst not. The persistence of complement activation and the negative effect on protective cellular Mechanisms in the liver May Explain the disparity Between the effects of prednisolone on the kidney and liver of rats BD. The difference in the molecular and cellular responses to prednisolone administration May Explain the contradictory evidence of the effects of prednisolone on different organ types from brain dead organ donors. © 2014 Rebolledo et al . licensee BioMed Central Ltd.;JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE;2014;Artículo;Medicine, research & experimental;0;liver;prednisolon;kidney;reduc;administr;;0;0;0;2;5;18;8;17;32
648;690;Serum Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 Levels Are Inversely Associated with Growth Rates in Infancy;Background: Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a metabolic and growth regulator.Aim: To investigate the role of growth in FGF21 During infancy.Methods: Blood samples for FGF21, leptin, insulin and glucose Collected from cord blood Were Obtained from 95 preterm and term newborns (crosssectional group), and at 6 and 12 months of life in 80 preterm infants and term (longitudinal group). Length and weight Were Measured at birth, 6 months, and 12 months.Results: From birth through 12 months of age, infants preterm 'linear growth and weight gain than larger Were Those of term infants, irrespective of birth weight SDS. At birth and at 12 months, there was no difference in FGF21 levels preterm and term infants Between in contrast, at 6 months, serum FGF21 in term infants was Significantly higher than That of preterm ones. In the 0-6-month period, in the whole longitudinal group, serum FGF21 was inversely correlated to the length change SDS, and such a significant inverse correlation persisted in the preterm-AGA group in the 6 to 12-month period. In Addition, term infants WHO catchup in the length experienced first 6 months of life exhibited lower serum FGF21 levels at 6 months, and Those With length catchup growth Between 6 and 12 months had a greater decrease of serum FGF21 level in the same time period.Conclusions: Our results Indicate That FGF21 in infancy is inversely correlated with linear growth rate, suggesting THUS That FGF21 is a negative regulator of human growth. © 2014 S.

649;703;A short protocol using dexamethasone and monophosphoryl lipid A generates tolerogenic dendritic cells that display a potent migratory capacity to lymphoid chemokines;Background: Generation of tolerogenic dendritic cells (TolDCs) for therapy is challenging due to ITS Implications for the design of protocols suitable for clinical applications, Which Means not only using safe products, but Also working at defining specific biomarkers for TolDCs identification, developing shorter DCs Obtaining TolDCs differentiation methods and with a stable phenotype. We describe here, a short-term protocol for TolDCs generation, Which are Characterized in terms of phenotypic markers, cytokines secretion profile, CD4 + T cell-stimulatory ability and capacity.Methods migratory: TolDCs from healthy Donors Were generated by dexamethasone plus modulation With monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA-tDCs). We performed an analysis of MPLA-TDCs in terms of yield, viability, morphology, phenotypic markers, cytokines secretion profile, stability, allogeneic and antigen-specific CD4 + T-cell stimulatory ability and capacity.Results migration: After 5-day culture, MPLA-tDCS reduced expression of costimulatory displayed and maturation molecules together to an anti-inflammatory cytokines secretion profile, being able to Maintain These tolerogenic features even after the engagement of CD40 by ITS cognate ligand. CD4 In Addition, MPLA-TDCs exhibited reduced capabilities to Stimulate allogeneic and antigen-specific T cell proliferation +, and induced an anti-inflammatory cytokine secretion pattern. Among tolerogenic potential markers Studied, only TLR-2 was highly Expressed in MPLA-TDCs When Compared To mature and immature DCs. Remarkable, like mature DCs, MPLA-TDCs displayed CCR7 and CXCR4 to high expression, chemokine receptors Both Involved in migration to secondary lymphoid organs, and even more, in an in vitro assay to They exhibited high migration towards CCL19 and CXCL12.Conclusion response: We describe a protocol for short-term TolDC generation, Which Confers them a stable phenotype and migratory capacity to lymphoid chemokines, essential features for TolDCs to be used as therapeutics for prevention of autoimmunity and graft rejection. © 2 García-González et al . licensee BioMed Central Ltd.;JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE;2013;Artículo;Medicine, research & experimental;0;toldc;mpla;tdcs;cytokin;generat;;0;0;0;12;6;12;8;13;27
650;785;Comparison of humoral neuroinflammation and adhesion molecule expression in two models of experimental intracerebral hemorrhage;Background: Inflammatory cascades Contribute to intracerebral hemorrhage after injury secondary (ICH) via humoral factors and cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Several experimental models Were Previously developed to analyze post-hemorrhagic neuroinflammation. However, neuroinflammatory markers Have Been Compared not face-to-face Between These models so far, and THEREFORE, pathophysiological conclusions drawn from only one single model May not be valid.Methods: We Compared neuroinflammatory pathways in the two murine models Most Common: striatal injection of autologous blood or collagenase. Expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, TNF-a, IFN-<U+03B3>, IL-6, TGF-ß and IL-10) as well adhesion molecule expression (VCAM-1, ICAM-1) was Analyzed by RT-PCR at time points after ICH Several induction. Outcome and physiological parameters Were Compared Between the models.Results: Both models induced a profound and dynamic Increase in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules. However, blood injection Resulted in significantly more pronounced alteration of These markers than collagenase injection. This difference was worse outcome associated With blood after injection Compared to the model collagenase ICH volumes.Conclusions DESPITE equal: This is the first study performing a face-to-face comparison of neuroinflammatory pathways in the two MOST Widely used murine ICH models, revealing substantial Differences Between the models. This need to be taken discrepancies into account in designing future studies Employing experimental ICH models, especially neuroinflammatory When analyzing pathways and therapies. © 2011 Liesz et al licensee BioMed Central Ltd.;Experimental and Translational Stroke Medicine;2011;Artículo;Medicine, research & experimental;0;ich;compar;face;inject;neuroinflammatori;;0;0;0;13;6;12;10;14;33
651;792;Protective effects of polyunsatutared fatty acids supplementation against testicular damage induced by intermittent hypobaric hypoxia in rats;Background: Intermittent hypobaric hypoxia (IHH) induces changes in the redox status and structure in rat testis. These effects May be present at high altitudes in people, Such as athletes and miners. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) can be effective in counteracting These oxidative Modifications due to Their properties antioxidants. The aim of the work was to test PUFA supplementation attenuates Whether in testis oxidative damage by reinforcing the antioxidant defense system. The divided into four animals Were groups (7 rats per group): normobaric normoxia (~750 tor 156 mmHg pO2 Nx) Nx + PUFA, Supplemented With PUFA (DHA: EPA = 3: 1 0.3 g kg-1 of body weight per day) hypoxic hypoxia (~428 tor pO2 90mmHg Hx) and, Hx + PUFA. The hypoxic groups Were exposed in four cycles to 96 h of HH followed by 96 h of normobaric normoxia for 32 days. Total antioxidant capacity (FRAP) and lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde, MDA) in plasma and reduced (GSH) / oxidized glutathione (GSSG) ratio, tissue lipid peroxidation (TBARS) and antioxidant enzymes activity Were Assessed at the end of the study in testis. Also, sirtuin 1 and HIF-1 protein expression in testis Were determined. Results: Increased lipid peroxidation IHH in plasma and HIF-1 protein levels in testis. In Addition, IHH FRAP reduced levels in plasma, antioxidant enzymes activities and Sirtuin 1 protein levels in testis. PUFA supplementation attenuated These effects, inducing the Increases in FRAP, in the antioxidant enzymes activity and HIF-1 levels. Conclusions: These results Suggest That the IHH model induces a prooxidant status in plasma and testis. The molecular protective effect of PUFA May Involve the induction of an antioxidant mechanism. © 2015 Castillo et al . licensee BioMed Central.;JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL SCIENCE;2015;Artículo;Medicine, research & experimental;0;antioxid;pufa;testi;ihh;plasma;;0;0;0;2;5;13;8;17;32

653;881;Isobolographic analysis of the opioid-opioid interactions in a tonic and a phasic mouse model of induced nociceptive pain;Background: Opioids Have Been Used for the management of pain and coadministration of two opioids May induce synergism. In a model of tonic pain, the acetic acid writhing test and in a phasic model, the hot plate, the antinociceptive interaction Between fentanyl, methadone, morphine, and tramadol was EVALUATED. Results: The potency of opioids in the writhing test Compared to the hot plate assay was from 2.5 (Fentanyl) to 15.5 (Morphine) times, respectively. The ED50was used in a fixed ratio for each of the six pairs of opioid combinations, Which, Resulted in a synergistic antinociception except for methadone / tramadol and fentanyl / tramadol Which Were additive, in the hot plate. The opioid antagonists naltrexone, naltrindole and north-binaltorphimine, Suggests That the synergism of morphine combinations are due to the activation of subtypes MOR With partially contribution of DOR and KOR, however fentanyl and methadone combinations are partially due to the activation of MOR and DOR subtypes KOR and lack of participation. The antinociceptive effects of tramadol combinations, are partially due to the activation of MOR, DOR and KOR opioid subtypes. Conclusion: These results suggets That effectiveness and magnitude of the interactions are dependent on opioids Between pain stimulus intensity. © 2014 Miranda et al .

654;887;Thyroid Hormone Administration Induces Rat Liver Nrf2 Activation: Suppression by N-Acetylcysteine Pretreatment;Background: Oxidative stress associated With 3,3 ', 5-triiodo-l- thyronine (T 3) -induced calorigenesis upregulates the expression of hepatic Mediators of cytoprotective Mechanisms. The aim was to study de este evaluate- the hypothesis in vivo T 3 That triggers administration redox-mediated nuclear translocation of the transcription factor erythroid cytoprotective 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) from the cytosol to the nucleus in rat liver. Such translocation of transcription factors is Considered to be an activating step. Materials and Methods: The effect of T 3 administration in the presence and absence of N-acetylcysteine <U+200B><U+200B>(NAC) on cytosol-to-nuclear translocation of Nrf2 was EVALUATED, with inhibition of esta process by NAC taken as evidence That the process was redox mediated . Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 180-200 g Were Given to intraperitoneal dose of 0.1 mg single T 3 / kg. Another group of rats Were Given the same dose of T 3 and Present Were pretreated With NAC (0.5 g / kg) at 0.5 T 3 hour before administration. Two other groups of rats received vehicle treatment and NAC, respectively. Following These treatments, rectal temperature of the animals, liver O 2 consumption, serum and hepatic levels of 8-isoprostanes, and liver protein levels of Nrf2, Akt, p38, and thioredoxin (Western blot) Were Determined at different times up to 48 hours . Results: T 3 administration induced a significant Increase in the levels of hepatic nuclear Nrf2 at 1 and 2 hours after treatment and a concomitant decrease in cytosolic Nrf2. Increased hepatic Also it thioredoxin, a protein gene transcription is induced Whose nuclear by Nrf2. Levels of nuclear Nrf2 Were at a plateau from 4 to 6 hours after T 3. Rectal temperature of the animals rose from 36.6 ° C to 37.5 ° C as did liver O 2 consumption. Serum and liver 8-isoprostanes levels Increased (p & lt 0.05) from 38.4 ± 4.0 pg / mL (n = 4) to 69.2 ± 2.0 pg / mL (n = 3) and from 0.75 ± 0.09 ng / g liver (n = 3) to 1.53 ± 0.10 ng / g liver (n = 5), respectively. In the group of rats pretreated With NAC, the Increase in cytosol-to-nuclear translocation of Nrf2 was only 28% by T 3. That induced In Addition, T 3 induced Akt and p38 activation liver During the period of 1-4 hours after T 3 administration. p38 activation at 2 hours after administration was abolished T 3 in NAC-pretreated animals. Conclusions: In vivo T 3 administration leads to a rapid and transient cytosol to-nuclear translocation-of liver Nrf2. This Appears to be Promoted by a redox-dependent mechanism as it is blocked by NAC. It May Also be Contributed by concomitant p38 activation, in turn Which Promoted Nrf2 phosphorylation. Nrf2 cytosol-to-nuclear translocation May Represent a novel cytoprotective mechanism of T 3 to limit free radical or electrophile toxicity, as esta would likely entail Promoting thioredoxin production. © 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.;THYROID;2011;Artículo;Medicine, research & experimental;0;nrf;liver;nuclear;administr;nac;;0;0;0;2;5;18;9;17;32
655;945;Crosslinking and mass spectrometry suggest that the isolated NTD domain dimer of Moloney murine leukemia virus integrase adopts a parallel arrangement in solution;Background: Retroviral integrases (INs) catalyze the integration of viral DNA in the chromosomal DNA of the infected cell. This reaction requires the multimerization of IN to coordinate a nucleophilic attack of the 3 'ends of viral DNA at two staggered phosphodiester bonds on the recipient DNA. Several models Indicate That a tetramer of IN would be required for two-end Concerted integration. Complementation assays That Have Shown the N-terminal domain (NTD) of integrase is essential for concerted integration, contributing to the formation of a multimer through protein-protein interaction. The isolated NTD of Mo-MLV integrase Behave as a dimer in solution however the structure of the dimer in solution is not known. Results: In this work, crosslinking and mass spectrometry to identify identity Were used in the dimerization Involved regions of the isolated Mo-MLV NTD. The distances Between the crosslinked lysines Within the monomer are in agreement With the structure of the NTD found in 3NNQ monomer. The intermolecular crosslinked peptides Corresponding to Lys 20 Lys 31 Lys 24 Lys 24 and Lys-68-Lys 88 Were identified. The 3D coordinates of 3NNQ Were used to derive a theoretical structure of the NTD dimmers With the 3D-Dock suite, based on shape and electrostatics complementarity, and filtered With the distance restraints in the crosslinking experiments Determined. Conclusions: The crosslinking results are consistent With the monomeric structure of NTD in 3NNQ, but for the dimer, in our model Both Polypeptides are oriented in parallel With each other and the Contacting areas Between the monomers would Involve the interactions Between helices 1 and helices 3 and 4. © 2 Henriquez et al . licensee BioMed Central Ltd.;BMC STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY;2013;Artículo;Medicine, research & experimental;0;lys;ntd;crosslink;dimer;dna;;0;0;0;12;6;12;8;7;4
656;946;Intasome architecture and chromatin density modulate retroviral integration into nucleosome;Background: Retroviral integration depends on the interaction Between intasomes, host chromatin and cellular cofactors targeting as LEDGF / p75 proteins or BET. Previous studies Indicated That the retroviral integrase, by itself, may play a role in the integration site selection Local nucleosomal DNA Within target. We focused our study on Local esta association by analyzing the intrinsic properties of various retroviral intasomes to Accommodate functionally different chromatin structures in the lack of other cofactors. Results: Using in vitro conditions Allowing the efficient catalysis of full site without These cofactors integration, we show That integrases are not equally distinct retroviral AFFECTED by chromatin compactness. Indeed, while PFV and MLV integration reactions into Favored are dense and stable nucleosomes, HIV-1 and ASV are preferred concerted integration reactions into poorly dense chromatin regions of our nucleosomal templates acceptor. Predicted integration sites around nucleosome occupancy Identified in infected cells Suggests the presence of a nucleosome at the MLV and HIV-1 integration sites surrounded by dense chromatin differently. Further analyzes of the relationships Between the in vitro integration site selectivity and the structure of the inserted DNA structural constraints Indicate That Could account for intasomes Within Their ability to Accommodate nucleosomal DNA and Could Dictate Their capability to bind nucleosomes These functionally in specific chromatin contexts. Conclusions: THUS, intasome Both architecture and compactness of the chromatin surrounding the targeted nucleosome Appear Important determinants of the retroviral integration site selectivity. This supports a mechanism Involving a global targeting of the intasomes Toward suitable chromatin regions followed by local integration site selection modulated by the intrinsic structural constraints of the target DNA intasomes governing the bending and dictating Toward Their sensitivity suitable specific nucleosomal structures and density. © Benleulmi et al.;RETROVIROLOGY;2015;Artículo;Medicine, research & experimental;0;integr;nucleosom;chromatin;site;intasom;;0;0;0;12;6;12;8;3;3

658;1094;Comparative genomic analysis uncovers 3 novel loci encoding type six secretion systems differentially distributed in Salmonella serotypes;"Background: The Type VI Described recently Secretion System (T6SS) Represents a new paradigm of protein secretion in bacteria. A number of bioinformatic Have Been Conducted studies to identify identity T6SS gene clusters in the available bacterial genome sequences. According To These studies, harbors a unique T6SS Salmonella encoded in the Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 6 (SPI-6). These studies since only few Considered Salmonella genomes, the present work to identify identity Aimed T6SS novel loci by in silico analysis of genome sequence of Salmonella every available. Results: The analysis of sequencing data from completed or in progress 44 Salmonella genome projects allowed the identification of three novel T6SS loci. These clusters are located in differentially-distributed genomic islands we designated SPI-19, SPI-20 and SPI-21, respectively. SPI-19 was Identified in a subset of S. enterica serotypes Including Dublin, Weltevreden, Agona, Gallinarum and Enteritidis. In the later, an internal deletion eliminated MOST of the island. On the other hand, SPI-20 and SPI-21 Were restricted to S. enterica subspecies arizonae (IIIa) serotype 62: z4, z23: -. Remarkably, SPI-21 encodes a protein VgrG container containing a C-terminal extension to a similar S-type pyocins of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This is not only the first Evolved VgrG Described in Salmonella, but the first Evolved VgrG Also Including a domain pyocin Described in the literature so far. In Addition, the data Indicate That SPI-6 T6SS is Widely distributed in S. enterica serotypes Enteritidis and absent in, Gallinarum, Agona, javiana, Paratyphi B, Virchow, IIIa 62: z4, z23: - and IIIb 61: 1, v : 1.5, (7). Interestingly, while some serotypes harbor multiple T6SS (Dublin, Weltvreden and IIIa 62: z4, z23 :-) others do not encode for any (Enteritidis, Paratyphi B, javiana, Virchow and IIIb 61: 1, v: 1.5, ( 7)). Comparative and phylogenetic analyzes That Indicate the 4 T6SS loci in Salmonella have a distinct evolutionary history. Finally, we Identified an orphan Hcp-like protein container containing the Hcp / COG3157 domain linked to a C-terminal extension. We propose to designate This and related proteins as \Evolved HCPs\"". Conclusion: Altogether, our data Suggest that (i) the Salmonella T6SS loci Were acquired by lateral transfer events independent and (ii) to Contribute evolved in the adaptation of the different serotypes to lifestyles and environments, Including the animal hosts.

659;1221;Heterozygous Mutations in Natriuretic Peptide Receptor-B (NPR2) Gene as a Cause of Short Stature;Based on the observation of reduced stature in Relatives of Patients With acromesomelic dysplasia, Maroteaux type (AMDM) Caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in natriuretic peptide receptor-B gene (NPR2), it Has Been Suggested That heterozygous mutations In This gene Could be responsible for the growth in some cases Observed impairment of idiopathic short stature (ISS). We enrolled 192 unrelated Patients With short stature and 192 controls standard of height and NPR2 heterozygous missense Identified seven or splice site mutations in the short stature all Patients, Including one splice site de novo variant. Three of the six inherited variants With short stature segregated in the family. Nine additional rare nonsynonymous variants NPR2 Were found in three additional cohorts. Functional studies Identified eight loss-of-function mutations in short Individuals and one gain-of-function mutation in tall Individuals. With These data, We were able to rigorously verify That NPR2 functional haploinsufficiency Contributes to short stature. We estimate a prevalence of NPR2 haploinsufficiency of Between 0 and 1/26 in People with ISS. © 2015 WILEY PERIODICALS, INC.;HUMAN MUTATION;2015;Artículo;Medicine, research & experimental;0;short;statur;mutat;npr;function;function;49;16;0.0108695652173913;12;6;19;4;18;9
660;1223;Bax Inhibitor-1-mediated Ca2+ leak is decreased by cytosolic acidosis;Bax Inhibitor-1 (BI-1) is an evolutionarily conserved transmembrane domain six-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein -localized That Protects against ER stress-induced apoptotic cell death. This function is closely connected to ITS ability to lower steady-state ER Ca2 + levels. Recently, we elucidated BI-1's Ca2 + -channel pore in the C-terminal part of the protein and amino acids Identified the critical pore of ITS. Based on These insights, Ca2 + -channel to pore-dead mutant BI-1 (BI-1D213R) was developed. We determined to bi-1 Whether behaves as a bona fide H + / Ca2 + antiporter or as an ER Ca2 + channel -leak by investigating the effect of pH on Ca2 + -efflux unidirectional rates. At pH 6.8, wild-type BI-1 expression in BI-1 - / - cells ER Ca2 + Increased the rate -leak, correlating With its localization in the ER compartment. In contrast, expression in 1D231R BI-BI-1 - / -, DESPITE ITS ER localization, did not Increase the ER Ca2 + -leak rate. However, at pH & lt 6.8, the BI-1 ER-mediated Ca2 + leak was blocked. Finally, to peptide + -channel Representing the Ca2 pore of BI-1 Promoting Ca2 + flux from the ER was used. Lowering the pH from 6.8 to 6.0 completely abolished the ability of the BI-1 peptide to mediate Ca2 + flux from the ER. We propose That esta pH dependence is due to two aspartic acid residues critical for the function of the Ca2 + -channel pore and located in the ER membrane-dipping domain, Which Facilitates the protonation of These residues. © 2 Elsevier Ltd.;CELL CALCIUM;2013;Artículo;Medicine, research & experimental;0;channel;pore;leak;local;abil;;0;0;0;5;5;5;9;7;4
661;1247;Glutamate-induced metabolic changes influence the cytoplasmic redox state of hippocampal neurons;Brain cell metabolism is intimately associated With intracellular oxidation-reduction (redox) balance. Glutamatergic transmission is Accompanied With changes in substrate preference in neurons. THEREFORE, we cytoplasmatic Studied in hippocampal neurons redox changes in culture exposed to glutamate. Neurons Were transfected With HYPER, a genetically encoded biosensor for hydrogen peroxide redox Which Allows Real-Time Imaging of the redox state. The rate of fluorescence decay, Corresponding to the reduction of the biosensor was found to be augmented by low doses of glutamate (10 .mu.m) as well as by pharmacological stimulation of NMDA glutamate receptors. Acute chelation of extracellular Ca2 + abolished the glutamate-induced effect on Hyper Observed fluorescence.

662;1256;The signalling pathway of CaMKII-mediated apoptosis and necrosis in the ischemia/reperfusion injury;Ca2 + -calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) plays an Important role mediating apoptosis / necrosis During ischemia-reperfusion injury (IR). We explored the Mechanisms of esta deleterious effect. Langendorff perfused rat hearts with and transgenic mice CaMKII sarcoplasmic reticulum to targeted inhibition (SR-AIP) Were subjected to IR overall. The onset of reperfusion Increased the site of phosphorylation of Thr17 Phospholamban, without changes in the total protein, consistent With An Increase in CaMKII activity. Instead, there was a proportional decrease in the phosphorylation of Ser2815 site of ryanodine receptors (RyR2) and the amount of RyR2 at the onset of reperfusion, i.e. the ratio Ser2815 / RyR2 did not change. Inhibition of the reverse Na + / Ca2 + exchanger (NCX) mode (KBR7943) Phospholamban diminished phosphorylation, reduced apoptosis / necrosis and enhanced mechanical recovery. CaMKII-inhibition (KN-93), Significantly Decreased Phospholamban phosphorylation, infarct area, lactate dehydrogenase release (LDH) (necrosis), TUNEL positive nuclei, caspase-3 activity, Bax / Bcl2 ratio and Ca2 + -induced mitochondrial swelling (apoptosis ), and Increased contractile recovery When Compared With non-treated hearts IR or IR hearts pretreated With the inactive analog, KN-92. Blocking SR Ca2 + loading and release (thapsigargin / dantrolene), mitochondrial Ca2 + uniporter (ruthenium red / RU360), or mitochondrial permeability transition pore (cyclosporine A), Significantly Decreased infarct size, LDH release and apoptosis. SR-AIP hearts failed to show an Increase in the phosphorylation of Thr17 of Phospholamban at the onset of reflow and exhibited a significant decrease in infarct size, apoptosis and necrosis respect to controls. The results reveal an apoptotic-necrotic pathway mediated by CaMKII-dependent phosphorylations at the SR, Which Involves the NCX reverse mode and the mitochondria as trigger and end effectors, respectively, of the cascade. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.;JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR CARDIOLOGY;2010;Artículo;Medicine, research & experimental;0;phosphoryl;apoptosi;camkii;decreas;heart;;0;0;0;5;5;5;9;11;10

664;1272;Preconditioning tachycardia decreases the activity of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore in the dog heart;Cardioprotection by preconditioning is the central issue of current research on heart function. Several reports Indicate That Preventing the assembly and opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) Protects the heart against ischemia-reperfusion injury. We Have Previously Reported That brief episodes of tachycardia decrease the infarct size produced by subsequent prolonged occlusion of a coronary artery, indicating That is an effective controlled preconditioning tachycardia maneuver. The effects of preconditioning tachycardia on mPTP activity Have not Been Reported. THEREFORE, In This work we Investigated if preconditioning tachycardia Protects against calcium-induced mitochondrial swelling, a measure of mPTP activity. We found That Decreased by 2.5 tachycardia-fold the rate of calcium-induced mitochondrial swelling, a factor That Contributes to the cardioprotective presumably effects of tachycardia. The oxidative status of the cell Increased after tachycardia, as evidenced by the decrease in the cellular and mitochondrial GSH / GSSG ratio.

Environmental parameters: such as the large day-night temperature Differences, high light radiation, low humidity and have a synergistic effect May With low oxygen pressure. To Evaluate the effects of the exposure to intermittent chronic hypobaric hypoxia (ichh) in nature on rat reproduction, a group of rats was Alternately Moved to a location at 3400 meters over sea level (MOML) for 7 days and returned the subsequent week to be level esta procedure was six times Repeated. Hematological and reproductive parameters Were Measured and Analyzed. At the end of the experimental protocol, hematocrit and hemoglobin Concentrations Were Significantly greater in the group ichh Compared to the Control group (Nx) (p <0.05). The seminiferous tubule diameter of the height and the spermatogenic epithelium of the rats in ichh presented a significant decrease in relation to Nx rats (p <0.05). Consequently, the number of epididymal spermatozoa in the experimental animals Decreased Compared to the normal rats, with no evidence of recovery after 84 days. The offspring of the matings different standard and hypoxic animals Decreased Between proportionally to hypoxia exposure. The low oxygen and the changes in testicular temperature homeostasis would Provide a local novel mechanism to Explain the decrease in sperm cell production and the reduced number of puppies born.

Here, we Studied epithalamic the pattern of asymmetry in zebrafish (Danio rerio) and medaka (Oryzias latipes), two related teleost species With 115-200 Myr of independent evolution. We found That These species share a strikingly conserved overall pattern of asymmetry in the parapineal-habenular interpeduncular-system. Nodal signaling spatial and temporal exhibits comparable expressions in the presumptive asymmetric PRECEDING epithalamus the development of morphological asymmetries. Neuroanatomical asymmetries consist of left-sided asymmetric positioning and connectivity of the parapineal organ, enlargement of neuropil in the left habenula Compared With the right habenula and segregation of left-right habenular efferents along the dorsal-ventral axis of the interpeduncular nucleus. DESPITE the overall conservation of asymmetry, we heterotopic Observed changes in the topology of parapineal efferent connectivity, heterochronic shifts in the timing of developmental events underlying the establishment of asymmetry and divergent degrees of canalization of embryo laterality.

Improved myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury to resistance (IR) injury results in non-lethal myocardial infarction, Which is a factor in the Relevant myocardial function. We hypothesized That chronic supplementation reduced infarct size With PUFAs (IS) and induced an improvement on oxidative stress-related parameters in IR model. Were Rats Supplemented with two doses of PUFAs D1 (n = 7) (0.6gkg-1d-1) and D2 (n = 7) (1.2gkg-1d-1) for 8weeks. Control group (n = 7) received only standard diet. In ex vivo model, all rat hearts subjected to 30 min of Were Global ischaemia followed by 120min of reperfusion. The left ventricular function and IS Were Assessed.

672;1521;A Role for the Insular Cortex in Long-Term Memory for Context-Evoked Drug Craving in Rats;Drug craving critically depends on the function of the interoceptive insular cortex, and may be triggered by contextual cues. However, the role of the insula in the long-term memory linking context remains unknown With drug craving. Such a memory trace in some probably reside neocortical region, much like other declarative memories. Studies in humans and rats Suggest That May include the insula Such a region. Rats chronically implanted With bilateral injection cannulae into the high-order agranular rostral insular cortex (RAIC) or the primary interoceptive posterior insula (PICs) Were conditioned to prefer the INITIALLY aversive compartment of a 2-compartment place preference apparatus by Repeatedly pairing it to amphetamine . We found a long-lasting but reversible loss (ca. 24 days) of amphetamine-conditioned place preference (CPP) and to Decreased expression in the insula of zif268, a crucial protein in memory reconsolidation, anisomycin When (ANI) was microinjected into the RAIC Immediately after the reactivation of the conditioned amphetamine / context memory. ANI infusion into the RAIC did not change without reactivation CPP, Whereas ANI infusion into pIC plus 15 days Caused loss of CPP. We also found 24 days loss of CPP When we reversibly inactivated pIC During extinction trials. These findings we interpret as evidence That the insular cortex, Including the RAIC, is Involved in a context / drug effect association. These results add to drug-related memory function to the insular cortex to the role of the Previously found pIC in the perception of craving or malaise. © 2012 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.

673;1543;Inactivation or non-reactivation: what accounts better for the silence of sex chromosomes during mammalian male meiosis?;During the first meiotic prophase in male mammals, sex chromosomes undergo a program of transcriptional silencing called meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI). MSCI is triggered by accumulation of proteins like BRCA1, ATR, and? H2AX on unsynapsed chromosomes, followed by changes locally on the sex chromatin, Including Histone Modifications, incorporation of specific histone variants, non-histone proteins, and RNAs. It is thought Generally MSCI That Represents the transition of unsynapsed transcriptionally active chromatin from a state to a state repressed. However, transcription is low in the whole Generally nucleus During the early stages of the first meiotic prophase, When markers of MSCI Appear first, and is then a globally reactivated During pachytene. THUS, an alternative Possibility That is the MSCI Represents targeted maintenance and / or reinforcement of a prior repressed state, i.e., a failure to reactivate. Here, we present an analysis of the temporal and spatial appearance of transcriptional and MSCI markers, as well as Modifications related to chromatin transcriptional regulation. We show levels of RNA pol That II histone H3 and acetylated at lysine 9 (H3K9ac) are low leptotene During, zygotene, and early pachytene, but Increase in mid-pachytene strongly, indicating reactivation That OCCURS With some delay after synapsis. However, while transcription markers on the autosomes abundantly Appear at midpachytene, They are not directed to the sex chromosomes. Interestingly, we found That chromatin Modifications related to transcriptional silencing and / or MSCI, Namely, histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 9 (H3K9me3), histone H3 monomethylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me1)? H2AX, SUMO1, and XMR, appear on the sex chromosomes autosomes Become reactivated before. These results Suggest That the onset of MSCI zygotene During late May and early pachytene sex chromosome reactivation Prevent During mid-pachytene INSTEAD OF Promoting inactivation de novo. Additionally, we found temporal Differences Between the X and Y chromosomes in the recruitment of DNA repair and MSCI markers, indicating a differential regulation of These processes. We propose That many of the meiotic defects Attributed to failure to silence sex chromosomes Could be Interpreted as more general process of transcriptional misregulation That OCCURS under Certain Circumstances in pathological zygotene and early pachytene. © Springer-Verlag 2012.;CHROMOSOMA;2012;Artículo;Medicine, research & experimental;0;msci;chromosom;transcript;sex;histon;;0;0;0;12;6;12;4;8;36

678;1776;Dexamethasone-induced autophagy mediates muscle atrophy through mitochondrial clearance;Glucocorticoids, dexamethasone Such as, Enhance protein ubiquitin-proteasome breakdown via system. However, the role of autophagy in organelle and protein turnover in the glucocorticoid-dependent atrophy program remains unknown. Here, we show That Stimulates an early dexamethasone activation of autophagy in L6 myotubes Depending on protein kinase, AMPK, and glucocorticoid receptor activity. Dexamethasone Several Increases expression of genes autophagy, Including ATG5, LC3, BECN1, and SQSTM1 and triggers AMPK-dependent mitochondrial fragmentation associated DNM1L With Increased protein levels. This process is required for mitophagy induced by dexamethasone. Inhibition of mitochondrial fragmentation by Mdivi-1 results in disrupted dexamethasone- induced autophagy / mitophagy. Furthermore, Mdivi-1 Increases the expression of genes associated With the program atrophy, suggesting mitophagy That May serve as part of the quality control process in dexamethasone-treated L6 myotubes. Collectively, These data Suggest a novel role for dexamethasone-induced autophagy / mitophagy in the regulation of the muscle atrophy program. © 2014 Landes Bioscience.;CELL CYCLE;2014;Artículo;Medicine, research & experimental;0;dexamethason;autophagi;mitophagi;protein;atrophi;protein;107;5;0.0237355811889973;5;5;5;9;11;2
679;1778;Myo1c binding to submembrane actin mediates insulin-induced tethering of GLUT4 vesicles;GLUT4 vesicles-container containing the plasma membrane Between cycle and intracellular compartments. Insulin Promotes GLUT4 GLUT4 vesicle exocytosis by regulating cell arrival at the periphery and Its subsequent tethering, docking, and fusion plasma With the membrane. The molecular machinery Involved in GLUT4 vesicle tethering is unknown. We show here That Myo1c, an actin-based engine Associates With That protein membranes and actin filaments, is required for insulin-induced vesicle tethering in muscle cells. Myo1c was found to associate With Both mobile and tethered GLUT4 vesicles and to be required for vesicle capture in the Total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) zone beneath the plasma membrane. Myo1c knockdown or overexpression of an actin binding-deficient mutant Myo1c abolished insulin-induced vesicle immobilization, GLUT4 vesicle Increased velocity in the TIRF zone, and preventer Their externalization. Conversely, overexpression Myo1c Immobilized GLUT4 vesicles in the TIRF zone and insulin-induced GLUT4 Promoted exposure to the extracellular milieu. Myo1c Also Contributed to insulin-dependent actin filament remodeling. THUS That we propose interaction of vesicular Myo1c With cortical actin filaments is required for insulin-mediated tethering of GLUT4 vesicles and for efficient delivery surface GLUT4 in muscle cells. © 2012 Boguslavsky et al.;MOLECULAR BIOLOGY OF THE CELL;2012;Artículo;Medicine, research & experimental;0;glut;vesicl;myoc;insulin;actin;;0;0;0;5;5;5;9;11;44
680;1781;Cellular levels of heme affect the activity of dimeric glutamyl-tRNA reductase;Glutamyl-tRNA reductase (GluTR) is the first enzyme Committed to tetrapyrrole biosynthesis by the C5-pathway. This enzyme transforms glutamyl-tRNA into glutamate-1-semi-aldehyde, Which is then a Transformed into levulinic acid 5-amino-1 by the glutamate-semi-aldehyde 2,1-aminomutase. Binding of heme to GluTR Seems to be Relevant to Regulate the enzyme function. Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans Recombinant GluTR from an acidophilic bacterium That Participates in bioleaching of minerals in Escherichia coli was Expressed and purified as a soluble protein container containing heme type b. Upon check of the cellular content of heme in E. coli, GluTR With Different levels of bound heme was Obtained. An inverse correlation Between the activity of the enzyme and the level of heme bound to GluTR Suggested control of the enzyme activity by heme. Heme bound preferentially to dimeric GluTR. An intact dimerization domain was essential for the enzyme to be fully active.

We Have Carried out in silico searches in order to genomic Identify FBA and enolase coding sequences in Echinococcus granulosus, the causative agent of cystic hydatid disease. Four genes and 3 FBA enolase genes Were found, and Their sequences and exon-intron structures Were Characterized and Compared to Those of Their orthologs in Echinococcus multilocularis, the causative agent of alveolar hydatid disease. To gather evidence of possible non-glycolytic functions, the expression profile of FBA and enolase isoforms detected in the E. granulosus pathogenic larval form (hydatid cyst) (EgFBA1 and EgEno1) was Assessed. Using specific antibodies, EgFBA1 and EgEno1 Were detected in protoscolex and germinal layer cells, as expected, but They Were Also found in the hydatid fluid, Which contains excretory-secretory parasite's (ES) products. Besides, Both Were proteins found in protoscolex tegument and in vitro ES products, further suggesting possible non-glycolytic functions in the host-parasite interface. EgFBA1 modeled 3D structure Predicted to F-actin binding site, and the ability of EgFBA1 to bind actin was confirmed experimentally, Which was taken as an additional evidence of FBA multifunctionality in E. granulosus.

However, the contribution of Herp to other protein degradation pathways like autophagy and Its connection to other types of stress responses REMAIN unknown. Here we report Herp That Regulates autophagy to clear poly-ubiquitin (poly-Ub) protein aggregates. Proteasome inhibition and glucose starvation (GS) led to a high level of poly-Ub protein aggregation was drastically reduced by That knocking down stably Herp (shHerp cells). The enhanced removal of poly-Ub inclusions protected from death cells by glucose starvation Caused. Under basal conditions and after stress increasingly, higher levels LC3-II and GFP-LC3 puncta Were Observed in shHerp cells Compared to cells control. Herp knockout basal cells displayed up-regulation of two essential autophagy-Atg5 regulators and Beclin-1, leading to autophagic Increased flux. Beclin-1 up-regulation was due to a reduction in Hrd1 dependent proteasomal degradation, and not at transcriptional level. The consequent higher autophagic flux was Necessary for the clearance of aggregates and for cell survival.

What features of a scene guide eye movements in natural vision? We recorded eye movements of three monkeys During free exploration of the natural scenes and propose a single model to Explain Their dynamics. We use the spatial clustering of fixation positions to define the monkeys' Subjective regions-of-interest (ROI) in a natural scenes. MOST images for the Subjective ROIs Significantly match the computed saliency of the nature scene, except When the image contains human or primate faces. We Also Investigated the temporal sequence of eye movements by computing the probability That will be a fixation made inside or outside of the ROI, Given the current fixation position. We Markov chain model fitted to the sequence of fixation positions, and find That fixations made inside a ROI are more likely to be followed by another fixation in the same ROI.

Several Mechanisms internalization Have Been Described in literature, Such as endocytosis and transduction. In This work we study the mechanism in HeLa cells internalization of two TIRAP derived peptides: pepTIRAP and pepTIRAPALA, Where some of the cationic amino acids Were Replaced With alanines. Detailed analysis of internalization and the electrostatic potential peptides was Carried out, to shed light on the internalization mechanism involved. Molecular modeling studies Showed That the main difference Identified Between pepTIRAP and pepTIRAPALA is the distribution of Their electrostatic potential field. The structure of pepTIRAP displays a predominantly positive potential When Compared to pepTIRAPALA, Which has a more balanced distribution potential. In Addition, docking experiments show That interactions Between pepTIRAP and negatively charged molecules on the cellular surface heparan sulfate Such as are stronger than the ones exhibited by pepTIRAPALA. A mathematical model was to quantify the Proposed amount of internalized or non-peptide bound to the membrane Specifically. The model Indicates a stronger interaction of the plasma membrane With pepTIRAP, Compared to pepTIRAPALA. We propose These discrepancies are related to the Differences in the electrostatic potential Characteristics of each peptide. In the case of pepTIRAP, lead to the These interactions formation of nucleation zones, Which are the first stage of the internalization transduction mechanism.

702;2562;Mitochondrial Ca2+ signals in autophagy;Macroautophagy (autophagy) is a lysosomal degradation pathway is conserved from yeast That to humans That plays an Important role in cellular recycling Constituents in all cells. A number of protein complexes and signaling pathways impinge on the regulation of autophagy, with the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) as the main player in the canonical pathway. Cytoplasmic Ca2 + signaling Also Regulates autophagy, with activating and inhibitory effects Both, mediated by the canonical as well as non-canonical pathways. Here we review esta regulation, with a focus on the role of an mTOR-independent pathway inositol trisphosphate That Involves the receptor (InsP3R) Ca2 + release and Ca2 + channel signaling to mitochondria. Constitutive InsP3R Ca2 + transfer to mitochondria is required for autophagy suppression in cells in nutrient-replete media. In Its absence, cells metabolically compromised due to Become Insufficient production of reducing equivalents to support oxidative phosphorylation. Absence of Ca2 + esta transfer to mitochondria results in activation of AMPK, mTOR-independent Which activates pro-survival autophagy.

704;2600;A High Incidence of Meiotic Silencing of Unsynapsed Chromatin Is Not Associated with Substantial Pachytene Loss in Heterozygous Male Mice Carrying Multiple Simple Robertsonian Translocations;Meiosis is a complex type of cell division That Involves homologous chromosome pairing, synapsis, recombination, and segregation. When any of These Processes is altered, cellular checkpoints and arrest meiosis progression induces cell elimination. Particularly meiotic impairment is frequent chromosomal translocations in bearing organisms. When chromosomal translocations Appear in heterozygosis, the chromosomes Involved May not correctly complete synapsis, recombination, and / or segregation, THUS Promoting the activation of checkpoints That lead to the death of the meiocytes. In mammals and other organisms, the unsynapsed chromosomal regions are subject to a process called meiotic chromatin silencing of unsynapsed (MSUC). Different degrees of asynapsis Could Contribute to disturb the usual loading of MSUC proteins, interfering With autosome and sex chromosome gene expression and triggering a massive pachytene cell death. We report That in mice heterozygous for That are Robertsonian translocations eight multiple single, pachytene spermatocytes bear MOST trivalents With That unsynapsed regions incorporate, in a stage-dependent manner, Proteins Involved in MSUC (eg, <U+03B3>H2AX, ATR, ubiquitinated-H2A, sumo 1, and XMR). These spermatocytes MSUC have a correct response and are not eliminated During pachytene and MOST of them proceed into diplotene. However, we found a high incidence of apoptotic spermatocytes at the metaphase stage. These results Suggest That in Robertsonian mice heterozygous synapsis defects on MOST pachytene cells do not trigger a prophase-I checkpoint. Instead, meiotic impairment Seems to mainly rely on the action of a checkpoint at the metaphase stage acting. That we propose a low stringency of the pachytene checkpoint Could help to Increase the chances That spermatocytes With synaptic defects will complete meiotic divisions and differentiate into gametes feasible.

Recent studies with a miR-122-specific nucleic acid antagomir locked it to be shown Have an Important host target for therapeutic intervention. However, significant controversy exists Concerning the Mechanisms underlying the dependence of HCV replication on miR-122.

In mammalian skeletal myotubes, depolarizing stimuli induce cytoplasmic Ca2 + two independent signals: a fast signal associated With a contraction and slow signal propagates That Regulates to the nucleus and gene expression. How mitochondria sense and possibly cytoplasmic Ca2 + Affect These signals have not Been Reported. We Investigated here (a) the emergence of mitochondrial Ca2 + signals in response to electrical stimulation of myotubes, (b) the contribution of mitochondrial Ca2 + transients to ATP generation and (c) the influence of mitochondria as modulators of cytoplasmic nuclear and Ca2 + signals. Rhod2 and Fluo3 fluorescence Ca2 + Determinations revealed composite signals associated to the mitochondrial compartment in electrically stimulated (400 pulses, 45Hz) skeletal myotubes. Similar Ca2 + signals Were detected When using a mitochondria-targeted pericam. The fast mitochondrial Ca2 + rise was induced by stimulation inhibited by pre-incubation With ryanodine, the phospholipase C inhibitor Whereas U73122 blocked the mitochondrial Ca2 + signal slow, showing the two sense mitochondria That cytoplasmic Ca2 + signal components.

Mutations in MCT8 are severe psychomotor retardation associated With, high and low serum T3 3,3 ', 5'-triiodothyronine (rT3) levels. Here we report MCT8 three novel mutations. Two subjects With the F501del mutation mild psychomotor retardation Have With slightly elevated T3 and rT3 standard levels. T3 uptake was mildly AFFECTED in F501del fibroblasts and fibroblasts from strongly Decreased in Patients MCT8 other, while T3 efflux was always strongly reduced. , Moreover, type 3 deiodinase activity was highly elevated in F501del fibroblasts, it was reduced in Whereas fibroblasts from other MCT8 Patients, probably reflecting variation in cellular parallel T3 content. Additionally, T3-responsive genes upregulated by T3 Were markedly F501del treatment in fibroblasts but not in fibroblasts with other vouchers MCT8 mutations. In conclusion, mutations in MCT8 result in a T3 uptake in skin Decreased fibroblasts. The much milder clinical phenotype of Patients With the F501del mutation May be correlated With the Relatively small decrease in T3 uptake combined With an even greater decrease in T3 efflux.

710;2661;Targeting the UPR transcription factor XBP1 protects against Huntington's disease through the regulation of FoxO1 and autophagy;Mutations leading to expansion of a poly-glutamine track in Huntingtin (Htt) causes Huntington's disease (HD). Signs of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress Have Been Recently Reported in the animal models of HD, associated With the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Here We Have Investigated the functional contribution of ER stress to the HD by targeting expression of two main UPR transcription factors, XBP1 and ATF4 (Activating transcription factor 4), in full-length mutant Huntingtin (mHtt) transgenic mice. XBP1-deficient mice Were more resistant to developing disease features, neuronal survival associated With improved performance and engine, and a drastic decrease in mHtt levels. The protective effects of XBP1 deficiency Were Associated With Enhanced macroautophagy in Both models of cellular and Animal HD. In contrast, ATF4 did not alter mHtt deficiency levels. , Although, XBP1 mRNA splicing in the striatum was Observed of HD transgenic brains, no changes in the levels of ER stress markers classical Were detected in symptomatic animals. At the mechanistic level, we Observed That led to XBP1 deficiency augmented expression of forkhead box O1 (FoxO1), a key transcription factor regulating autophagy in neurons. In agreement With This finding, ectopic expression of autophagy and mHtt FoxO1 enhanced clearance in vitro. Our results Provide strong evidence supporting an Involvement of XBP1 in HD pathogenesis probably due to an ER stress-independent mechanism Involving the Control of Foxo1 and autophagy levels. © The Author 2012.

717;2892;Investigation of C9orf72 in 4 Neurodegenerative Disorders;Objective: To estimate the allele frequency of C9orf72 (G4C 2) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Repeats (ALS), frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), Alzheimer disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Design: The number of repeats was Estimated by a 2-step genotyping strategy. For expansion carriers, we sequenced the repeat flanking regions and APOE genotypes and MAPT Obtained H1 / H2 haplotypes. Setting: Hospitals specializing in neurodegenerative disorders. Subjects: We Analyzed Patients With FTLD 520, 389 Patients With ALS Patients With AD 424, 289 Patients With PD, 602 controls, 18 families, and 29 Patients With LRRK2 G2019S PD With the mutation. Main Outcome Measure: The expansion frequency. Results: Based on a prior cutoff (& gt 30 repeats), the expansion was detected in 9.3% of Patients With ALS, 5.2% of Patients With FTLD, and 0.7% of Patients With PD but not in controls or Patients With AD. It was Significantly associated with family history of ALS or FTLD and age at onset of FTLD. Phenotype variation (ALS vs FTLD) was not associated With MAPT, APOE, or variability in the repeat flanking regions. Two Patients With PD Were carriers of 39 and 32 repeats With questionable pathological significance, since the 39-repeat allele does not segregate With PD. No expansion or intermediate alleles (20-29 repeats) Were found Among the G2019S carriers and AD cases With TAR DNA-binding protein 43-positive inclusions. Surprisingly, the frequency of the 10-repeat allele was marginally in all four Increased neurodegenerative diseases Compared With controls, indicating the presence of an unknown variation in the C9orf72 risk locus. Conclusions: The C9orf72 expansion is a common cause of ALS and FTLD, but not of AD or PD. Our study raises concern About a reliable cutoff for the pathological repeat number, Which is Important in the utility of genetic screening. © 2012 American Medical Association.

718;2904;Physicians' attitudes and adherence to use of risk scores for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: cross-sectional survey in three world regions;Objective: To Evaluate physicians' attitudes and adherence to the use of risk scores in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Design and Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 2056 physicians Involved in the primary prevention of CVD. Participants included cardiologists (47%), general practitioners (42%), and endocrinologists (11%) from Several regions geographical: Brazil (n = 968), USA (n = 381), Greece (n = 275), Chile (n = 157), Venezuela (n = 128), Portugal (n = 42), The Netherlands (n = 41), and Central America (Costa Rica, Panama, El Salvador and Guatemala n = 64). Results: The main outcome measure was the percentage of responses on a multiple-choice questionnaire Describing a hypothetical asymptomatic patient at intermediate risk for CVD ACCORDING TO the Framingham Risk Score. Only 48% of Respondents Reported Regular use of CVD risk scores to tailor preventive treatment in the case scenario. Of non-users, three-quarters Nearly Indicated that 'It takes up too much of my time' (52%) or 'I do not believe They add value to the clinical evaluation' (21%). Only 56% of Respondents Indicated That They would prescribe lipid-lowering therapy for the hypothetical intermediate-risk patient. A greater proportion of Significantly Regular users than non-users of CVD risk scores the need for Identified lipid-lowering therapy in the hypothetical patient (59 vs. 41% p <0.0001). Conclusions: Based on a Survey Conducted in a 'real-world' setting, risk scores are not used by a Generally majority of physicians to guide primary prevention in asymptomatic persons at intermediate risk for CVD. Appropriate prescribing of lipid-lowering therapy in Patients Such is equally neglected. Changing physicians' attitudes towards the use of CVD risk scores is one of several challenges That need to be addressed to reduce the world-wide burden of CVD. © 2009 Informa UK Ltd.

724;3207;Pentamidine exerts in vitro and in vivo anti Trypanosoma cruzi activity and inhibits the polyamine transport in Trypanosoma cruzi;Pentamidine is an antiprotozoal and fungicide drug used in the treatment of leishmaniasis and African trypanosomiasis. DESPITE ITS EXTENSIVE use as antiparasitic drug, little evidence exists About the effect of pentamidine in Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas' disease. Recent studies Have Shown That pentamidine blocks to polyamine transporter present in Leishmania major consequently, ITS Might Also block in T. cruzi These transporters. T. cruzi Considering That lacks the ability to synthesize putrescine de novo, the inhibition of polyamine transport can bring a new therapeutic target against the parasite. In This work, we show Decreases That pentamidine, not only the viability of T. cruzi trypomastigotes, But Also the parasite burden of infected cells. In T. cruzi-infected mice pentamidine Decreases the inflammation and parasite burden in hearts from infected mice. The treatment Also Decreases parasitemia, RESULTING in an Increased survival rate. In Addition, pentamidine strongly Inhibits putrescine and spermidine the transport in T. cruzi epimastigotes and amastigotes. THUS, This study points to reevaluate the utility of pentamidine and introduce evidence of a potential new action mechanism. In the quest of new therapeutic strategies against Chagas disease, the extensive use of pentamidine in human has led to a well-known clinical profile, Which Could be an advantage over newly synthesized molecules That requires more comprehensive clinical trials prior to Their use. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.;ACTA TROPICA;2014;Artículo;Medicine, research & experimental;0;pentamidin;cruzi;transport;decreas;infect;infect;100;7;0.0221827861579414;6;4;17;4;5;28
725;3219;Dexmedetomidine preconditioning activates pro-survival kinases and attenuates regional ischemia/reperfusion injury in rat heart;Pharmacological preconditioning myocardial infarct size limits after ischemia / reperfusion. Dexmedetomidine is an a 2 adrenergic receptor agonist used-in anesthesia That May Have cardioprotective properties against ischemia / reperfusion injury. We investigate Whether dexmedetomidine administration activates kinases and induces cardiac survival regional cardioprotection against ischemia / reperfusion injury. In vivo and ex vivo models, rat hearts subjected to 30 min regional Were of ischemia followed by 120min of reperfusion With dexmedetomidine before ischemia. The a 2 adrenergic receptor antagonist yohimbine-Present was Given before ischemia, alone or With dexmedetomidine. ERK1 / 2, Akt and eNOS phosphorylations Were Determined before ischemia / reperfusion. Cardioprotection after regional ischemia / reperfusion was Assessed from ventricular infarct size measurement and recovery function. Localization of a 2 adrenergic receptors in cardiac-tissue was Present Assessed. Dexmedetomidine preconditioning Increased levels of phosphorylated Erk1 / 2, Akt and eNOS forms before ischemia / reperfusion Significantly being reversed by yohimbine in Both models. Dexmedetomidine preconditioning (in vivo model) and peri-insult protection (ex vivo model) Significantly reduced myocardial infarction size, and functional recovery improved yohimbine abolished dexmedetomidine-induced cardioprotection in Both models. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY-294002 myocardial infarction size reduction reversed dexmedetomidine induced by preconditioning. The three isotypes of a 2 adrenergic receptors Were-detected in the whole cardiac tissue Whereas only the subtypes 2A and 2C Were Observed in isolated adult rat cardiomyocytes.

The present studies tested the feasibility of Achieving a long-term reduction of chronic and post-deprivation binge ethanol drinking by a single administration into the brain ventral tegmental area (VTA) of a lentiviral vector That codes for aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (ALDH2), Gradients Which acetaldehyde. The ALDH2 gene coding for lentiviral vector or vector control microinjected into the VTA Were of rats bred for Their spirit preference. In the chronic administration model Alcohol, naïve animals administered the vector control and subsequently offered Preferred 10% ethanol and water ingested 8.9-g ethanol / kg body weight / day. The single administration of the ALDH2-coding vector prior to Allowing ethanol availability reduced by 85-90% ethanol drinking (P - <- 0.001) for the 45 days tested. In the post-deprivation binge-drinking model, animals That ADH with previously consumed ethanol chronically for 81 days Were administered the lentiviral vector and Were thereafter deprived of ethanol for three 7-day periods, each interrupted by a single 60-minute ethanol re-access after the last day of each period deprivation.

The standard diploid karyotype of the house mouse chromosomes Consisting of 40 May telocentric be reduced by the emergence of Rb metacentric chromosomes. Multiple simplest form trivalents Rb heterozygotes exhibiting higher frequency and consequently anaphase nondisjunction number of unbalanced gametes higher than in the normal ills. This work will attempt to Establish Whether frequencies of aneuploidy in heterozygote Observed spermatids of the M. musculus domesticus house mouse show Differences in different chromosomes derived from trivalents.

730;3514;Salsolinol, free of isosalsolinol, exerts ethanol-like motivational/sensitization effects leading to increases in ethanol intake;Salsolinol is FORMED When non-enzymatically-derived ethanol to acetaldehyde binds dopamine, yielding 2 distinct products, i.e., salsolinol and isosalsolinol. Early Animal studies, revealing That salsolinol Promotes Alcohol consumption and recent evidence That animals will Readily self-administer salsolinol into the posterior ventral tegmental area (p-VTA) Together with the finding That salsolinol is able to induce conditioned place preference and to locomotor Increase activity , have outlined a role of salsolinol in the behavioral and neurobiological actions of ethanol. Until recently, the only commercially available salsolinol was a mixture Containing 85% salsolinol and 10-15% isosalsolinol. The Possibility That Either salsolinol THUS exists or isosalsolinol Explains the reinforcing properties of ethanol. We report here a newly available salsolinol That is free of isosalsolinol. THUS, salsolinol, free of isosalsolinol, was injected intracerebrally (30 pmol / 0.2µL, into the ventral tegmental area [VTA]) or intraperitoneally (ip) (10mg / kg) to naive rats bred as alcoholic drinkers to study salsolinol's motivational effects and ITS role on voluntary ethanol intake. Salsolinol produced conditioned place preference and locomotor activity Increased, intra-VTA Whether or injected intraperitoneally. Following systemic (i.p.) administration of 10 mg / kg salsolinol, esta invivo molecule was detected by microdialysis of neostriatum, reaching an Estimated concentration of 100nM in the dialyzate.

The overall aim of study was to investigate esta to what extent BDNF Could Participate in the generation and maintenance of trigeminal neuropathic pain. The results Showed That intracisternal administration of nanogram acute doses of BDNF in naïve mice elicited long-lasting, dose-related, cold allodynic responses to topical application of acetone vibrissal pad onto skin. The systemic administration of cyclotraxin-B (CTX-B), a new TrkB receptor antagonist, or propentofylline, an inhibitor of glial activation, was able to Prevent or reverse the Either effects of BDNF on intracisternal cold nociception. In Addition, the blockade of TrkB receptor by CTX-B inhibited the Mechanisms That Either cold allodynia Maintain or initiate in the ipsilateral vibrissal pad skin after unilateral constriction of the infraorbital nerve. These observations raise the Possibility That BDNF is capable of Conveying on Its Own many features of the Signaling Mechanisms That Caused by Central sensitization underlie nerve constriction.

734;3655;Sphingomyelinase-Induced Domain Shape Relaxation Driven by Out-of-Equilibrium Changes of Composition;Sphingomyelinase (SMase) -induced ceramide (Cer) -enriched in a lipid monolayer domains are shown to result from an out-of-equilibrium situation. This is induced by a change of composition Caused by the enzymatic production of Cer in a sphingomyelin (SM) monolayer That leads to a fast SM / Cer demixing into a liquid-condensed (LC), Cer-enriched and a liquid-expanded, SM -enriched phases. The morphological evolution and kinetic dependence of Cer-enriched domains is Studied under continuous observation by epifluorescence microscopy. Domain shape annealing is observed from branched to SMase activity rounded shapes after quenching by EDTA, with a decay halftime of ~10 min. An out-of-equilibrium domain fast growth is not the determinant factor for domain morphology. Domain rearrangement shape equilibrium conditions result in Nearly from the counteraction of intradomain dipolar repulsion and line voltage, According to McConnell's shape transition theory. Phase separation causes a transient overshoot Within the compositional phase LC That IMPLIES an Increased out-of-equilibrium enrichment of Cer into the LC domains. As a consequence, higher intradomain repulsion leads to transient branched structures to rounded shapes That relaxation by lowering the proportion of Cer in the domain to equilibrium values. The fast action of SMase can be taken as a compositional perturbation That Brings About Important Consequences for the surface organization. © 2009 by the Biophysical Society.;BIOPHYSICAL JOURNAL;2009;Artículo;Medicine, research & experimental;0;domain;cer;enrich;equilibrium;shape;;0;0;0;12;6;12;6;11;40

Liver reduced glutathione (GSH) content and Nrf2 (Western blot) Were Measured 24 h after each dose Fe. Increased hepatic Fe deposition (Perls staining) was paralleled by reversible GSH depletion and enhancements in nuclear Nrf2 content and in nuclear / cytosolic Nrf2 ratios. A profile like heme oxygenase was Observed for-1 (HO-1) and NADPH-quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO-1) contents, antioxidant enzymes That Significantly Correlated With nuclear / cytosolic Nrf2 ratios. Normalization of Fe-induced oxidative stress status occurred concomitantly With That of Nrf2 and Nrf2-dependent With the HO-1 and NQO-1 expression, Which are associated With Keap1 delayed enhancement in cytosolic levels. This is in agreement With the significant inverse correlation of nuclear / cytosolic Nrf2 Those ratios of nuclear Keap1 With / Nrf2, suggesting a negative feed-back mechanism Normalizing Nrf2 signaling. In conclusion, sub-chronic Fe administration leads to transient liver oxidative stress development and Nrf2 activation, as evidenced by early GSH depletion, nuclear enhanced Nrf2 protein levels, and HO-1 and NQO-1 induction, with late normalization of These changes being related Keap1 to upregulation. © 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry.;FOOD & FUNCTION;2014;Artículo;Medicine, research & experimental;0;nrf;nuclear;cytosol;keap;liver;;0;0;0;2;5;18;9;17;32

737;3707;Transcription directed by human core promoters with a HomolD box sequence requires DDB1, RECQL and RNA polymerase II machinery;TATA box is the MOST Studied core promoter element and has a well-Described transcription mechanism. However, Most metazoan TATA box LACK Promoters and other core elements Contain promoter. One of Such elements is HomolD box, Which was first Described in Promoters of ribosomal protein genes in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and studies performed in esta model Showed That transcription directed by HomolD box is dependent on RNAPII machinery, and the HomolD-binding protein was Rrn7, a core component of RNAPI factor. NEVERTHELESS, the Mechanisms That underlie HomolD-dependent transcription are still unknown. The purpose of this study is to determine the mechanism of transcription directed by human HomolD box. By stepwise purification through different ion exchange columns and affinity chromatography, we purified two proteins: DDB1 and RECQL (DNA damage-binding protein 1 and ATP-dependent DNA helicase Q1 respectively). These proteins Showed specific activity and binding HomolD-Were required for in vitro transcription-directed HomolD. Recombinant RECQL, but not DDB1, presented HomolD-binding activity in vitro. Both proteins bound to HomolD box in vivo, Which Could Be Explained Because These proteins co-immunoprecipitated. Additionally, RNAPII Also required machinery was to transcription. Collectively, Data Suggest That These HomolD-Containing Promoters require the RNAPII machinery and the proteins DDB1 and RECQL for an accurate transcription. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.;GENE;2012;Artículo;Medicine, research & experimental;0;homold;protein;transcript;box;promot;protein;107;5;0.0237355811889973;12;6;12;8;18;7

We explored the hypothesis esta That phenomenon is Explained by an enhancement of REM sleep photic masking, as a consequence of damage in the LH. Orexin-B-saporin neurotoxic lesions induced in the LH Were of male Sprague-Dawley rats. LH-lesioned and control rats Were sleep-recorded successively under 12:12 light / dark (LD) and skeleton photoperiod. Compared to controls, lesioned rats exhibited 50% less and 82% more REM sleep and rest During active phases, respectively, under the 12:12 LD schedule. After transference to a skeleton photoperiod, lesioned rats exhibited an 88% increase in REM sleep During the rest phase, Recovering the rest characteristic of REM sleep phase preference Observed Among rats control. The Increase in REM sleep phase During rest the skeleton photoperiod was positively correlated With the magnitude of the LH lesion. Our results Suggest That changes in the temporal organization of sleep-wake states Observed Among neurotoxic lesions in rats With the lateral hypothalamus and rodent models of narcolepsy-cataplexy May be Explained by the enhancement of photic masking. © 2 European Sleep Research Society.;JOURNAL OF SLEEP RESEARCH;2011;Artículo;Medicine, research & experimental;0;sleep;lesion;rat;rem;among;rat;45;20;0.00998225377107365;3;6;3;1;28;26
742;3732;Detection of patients with functional dyspepsia using wavelet transform applied to their electrogastrogram;The aim of the present study was to Develop a classifier able to discriminate healthy controls and dyspeptic Between Patients by analysis of Their electrogastrograms. Fifty-six electrogastrograms Were Analyzed, Corresponding to 42 dyspeptic Patients and 14 healthy controls. The Original Were subsampled signals, filtered and divided into the pre-, post-, and prandial stages. A time-frequency transformation based on wavelets was used to extract the signal Characteristics, and a special selection procedure based on correlation was used to reduce Their number. The analysis was Carried out by different neural network Evaluating structures to classify the wavelet coefficients into two groups (healthy subjects and dyspeptic patients). The optimization process of the classifier led to a linear model. A dimension reduction That Resulted in only 25% of uncorrelated electrogastrogram gave inputs for the 24 Characteristics classifier. The prandial stage gave the Most Significant results. Under These conditions, the classifier Achieved 78.6% sensitivity, 92.9% specificity, and an error of 17.9 ± 6% (with a 95% confidence level).

745;3920;The frequency of heterologous synapsis increases with aging in Robertsonian heterozygous male mice;The house mouse is Characterized by highly varying chromosome number due to the presence of Robertsonian (Rb) chromosomes. During meiosis in heterozygotes Rb, intricated chromosomal figures are produced, and many regions are present unsynapsed During the first prophase, triggering a meiotic silencing of unsynapsed chromatin (MSUC) in a like mode to the sex chromosome inactivation. The presence of unsynapsed chromosome regions is associated With spermatogenesis impaired. Interestingly, in male mice carrying multiple Rb trivalents, the frequency of germ cell death, defective tubules, and altered sperm morphology Decreases During aging. Here, we Studied Whether synapsis of trivalent chromosomes and MSUC are Involved In This improvement. By immunocytochemistry, we analysed the frequency of unsynapsed chromosomes and of Those positive to <U+03B3>H2AX (a marker of MSUC) labeling in spermatocytes of 3-, 5- and 7-month-old heterozygotes Rb. With aging, we Observed a decrease of the frequency of unsynapsed chromosomes, of spermatocytes bearing them and of carrying trivalents <U+03B3>H2AX-negative unsynapsed regions.

Axonal degeneration in HAM / TSP OCCURS Patients without Neuron infection, with the viral protein secreted Tax Proposed to be involved. Previously we found secreted into the Tax That culture medium of MT-2 cells (HTLV-1-infected cell line) produced neurite retraction in neuroblastoma cells to neuronal type Differentiated. To ASSESS the relevance of posttranslational Tax Modifications on This effect, we addressed the question of Whether Tax secreted by MT-2 cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of HTLV-1-infected subjects is modified. The interaction of Tax With calreticulin (CRT) Tax That modulates intracellular localization and secretion has-been described. We Studied Tax localization and Modifications in MT-2 cells and Its Interaction With CRT. Intracellular Tax in MT-2 cells was Assessed by Flow Cytometry, Corresponding mainly to a 71-kDa protein followed by western blot. This Reported as a chimera protein gp21 With viral protein-confirmed by mass spectrometry-Showed no ubiquitination or SUMOylation. The Tax-CRT interaction by confocal microscopy was determined to and coimmunoprecipitation. Extracellular Tax from HAM / TSP PBMCs is ubiquitinated ACCORDING TO western blot, and Its Interaction With CRT was shown by coimmunoprecipitation. A positive Correlation between Tax and CRT secretion was Observed in HAM / TSP PBMCs and asymptomatic carriers. For inhibitors and activators Both proteins Showed secretion of secretion through the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi complex.

Establishing the existence of other types of cells That can process and secrete insulin Transgenic would help the development of new gene therapy strategies to treat Patients with Diabetes mellitus. It is NOTED That in Addition to GIP secreting K-cells, the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) generating L-cells share / many similarities to pancreatic ß-cells, Including the peptidases required for proinsulin processing, hormone storage and to glucosestimulated hormone secretion mechanism.

When the mouse enteroendocrine STC-1 cell line was transfected With the human preproinsulin gene, driven Either by the K-cell specific GIP promoter or by the constitutive cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, human insulin co-localizes in vesicles That Contain GIP (GIP or CMV promoter) or GLP-1 (CMV promoter). Exposure to glucose of engineered STC-1 cells led to a insulin marked secretion, Which was 7-fold greater When the insulin gene was driven by the CMV promoter (Expressed Both in K-cells and L-cells) than when it was driven by the GIP promoter (Expressed only in K-cells).

THUS, angiogenesis inhibition is an Important emerging cancer treatment. Many drugs are tested and shown interesting results Have corticosteroids. Herein we investigate the effect on microvessel density, survival time and tumor volume of mice With TA3-MTX-R tumors. Twenty six mice Were Inoculated With 1x10 6 tumor cells, 4-5 days after injection, six mice injected With Were PBS (group A) and twenty mice Were Treated With ß-met (group B). All animals from Group A on day 22. Group died B was divided into B1 (Treated discontinued) and B2 (Treated daily) and day 88.

757;4370;Calpains and proteasomes mediate degradation of ryanodine receptors in a model of cardiac ischemic reperfusion;Type-2 ryanodine receptors (RyR2) - the calcium release of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum channels - have central role in cardiac excitation-contraction coupling. In the heart, ischemia / reperfusion causes a rapid and significant decrease in RyR2 content but the Mechanisms responsible for esta effect are not fully Understood. We Have Studied the Involvement of three proteolytic systems - calpains, the proteasome and autophagy - on the degradation of RyR2 in rat neonatal cardiomyocyte cultures subjected to simulated ischemia / reperfusion (sI / R). We found That 8 h of ischemia followed by 16 h of reperfusion Decreased by 50% RyR2 content without any changes in RyR2 mRNA. Specific inhibitors of calpains and the proteasome preventer the decrease of RyR2 Caused by sI / R, implicating Both pathways in Its degradation. Proteasome inhibitors preventer Also the degradation of calpastatin, the endogenous calpain inhibitor, hindering the activation of calpain induced by calpastatin degradation. Autophagy was activated During sI / R as evidenced by the Increase in LC3-II and beclin-1, two proteins Involved in autophagosome generation, and in the emergence of GFP-LC3 container containing vacuoles in adenovirus-GFP transduced LC3 cardiomyocytes. Selective inhibition autophagy, however, even further RyR2 induced degradation, making unlikely the participation of autophagy in sI / R-induced degradation RyR2. Our results Suggest That calpain activation as a result of proteasome-induced degradation of calpastatin Initiates RyR2 proteolysis, Which is followed by proteasome-dependent degradation of the RESULTING RyR2 fragments. The decrease in content RyR2 During ischemia / reperfusion May be Relevant to the decrease of heart contractility after ischemia. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we generated skeletal-muscle-specific transgenic (TG) mice expressing the Na + -Ca2 + exchanger 1 (NCX1) to model ITS augmentation Identified During muscular dystrophy. The NCX1 transgene induced dystrophy-like disease in all hind-limb musculature, as well as muscle disease exacerbated the d-sarcoglycan phenotypes in (SGCD - / -), DYSF - / - and mdx mouse models of muscular dystrophy. Antithetically, muscle-specific deletion of the Slc8a1 (NCX1) gene hind-limb pathology diminished in SGCD - / - mice. Increases Measured in Na + and Ca2 baseline + in dystrophic muscle fibers of the hind-limb musculature predicts a net Ca2 + Influx state due to reverse-mode operation of NCX1, Which Mediates disease.

763;4502;Lipid domains in giant unilamellar vesicles and their correspondence with equilibrium thermodynamic phases: A quantitative fluorescence microscopy imaging approach;We report a novel analytical procedure to measure the surface areas of coexisting lipid domains in giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) based on image processing of 3D fluorescence microscopy data. The procedure Involves the segmentation of lipid domains from fluorescent image stacks and reconstruction of 3D domain using active surface morphology models. This method Permits the reconstruction of the spherical surface of GUVs and determination of the area fractions of coexisting lipid domains at the level of single vesicles. Obtaining fractions area Enables the scrutiny of the lever rule along lipid phase diagram's tie lines and to test whether or not the coexistence of lipid domains in GUVs Correspond to thermodynamic equilibrium phases. The analysis was applied to DLPC / DPPC GUVs displaying coexistence of lipid domains. Our results confirm the lever rule, demonstrating the Observed That Correspond to membrane domains thermodynamic equilibrium phases (i.e., solid and liquid ordered disordered phases). In Addition, the fact That the lever rule is validated from 11 to 14 randomly selected GUVs per molar fraction Indicates homogeneity in the lipid composition Among the GUV Populations explored. In conclusion, our study shows That GUVs are reliable model systems to perform thermodynamic equilibrium studies of membranes. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

588;827;Cellular and subcellular localization of Marlin-1 in the brain;Background: Marlin-1 is a microtubule binding protein associates That Specifically With the GABAB1 subunit in neurons and With members of the Janus kinase family in lymphoid cells. In Addition, it binds the molecular motor kinesin-I and Nucleic Acids, preferentially single stranded RNA. Marlin-1 is mainly Expressed in the Central nervous system but little is Known cellular and subcellular Regarding ITS distribution in the brain. Results: Here we Have Studied the localization of Marlin-1 in the rodent brain and cultured neurons combining immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and electron microscopy pre-embedding. We Demonstrate That Marlin-1 is enriched in restricted areas of the brain olfactory bulb Including, cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum. Marlin-1 is abundant in axons and dendrites of GABAergic and non-hippocampal GABAergic neurons. At the ultrastructural level, Marlin-1 is present in the cytoplasm and the nucleus of CA1 neurons in the hippocampus. In the cytoplasm it associates to microtubules in the dendritic shaft and occasionally With the Golgi apparatus, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and dendritic spines. In the nucleus, clusters of Marlin-1 associate to euchromatin. Conclusion: Our results Demonstrate That Marlin-1 is Expressed in discrete areas of the brain. They Also confirm the microtubule association at the ultrastructural level in neurons. Together with the abundance of the protein in dendrites and axons They are consistent With the emerging role of Marlin-1 as an intracellular protein linking the cytoskeleton and transport.

590;1249;Involvement of spinal cord BDNF in the generation and maintenance of chronic neuropathic pain in rats;Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is Involved in neuronal survival and plasticity of the synaptic Central and peripheral nervous system. In chronic pain, plastic changes in dorsal horn neurons Contribute to a phenomenon of hypersensitivity to pain sensation That is maintained over time, as Known Central sensitization. This process is Accompanied by BDNF overexpression, but the role of BDNF in the generation and maintenance of the hyperalgesic phenomenon is still unclear. The present study was Aimed to investigate if exogenous BDNF administered to the rat spinal cord, in Addition to trigger pain, Participates in the maintenance of the Central sensitization process (ie, pain persistence) and to determine if the pain generated is comparable to That Observed in a neuropathic pain model. Results Showed That a single intrathecal injection of 0.003. ng of BDNF was able to decrease the nociceptive threshold (Randall Selitto test-) in the normal rats, for at Least 42-day period. Furthermore, the hyperalgesia was comparable to generated That Observed in rats with a 42-day history of mononeuropathy. Increasing the dose or doses of BDNF Administering additional Resulted in neither the additional effectiveness in reducing pain threshold nor in the prolongation of the hyperalgesic effect, showing THUS Central sensitization induced by BDNF That is a dose-independent, all-or-none process. It is Concluded That BDNF alone is sufficient for generating a long-lasting neural excitability change in the spinal cord via receptor tyrosine kinase B signaling, similar to That Observed in chronic pain models: such as neuropathy. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.;BRAIN RESEARCH BULLETIN;2011;Artículo;Neurosciences;0;bdnf;pain;central;generat;addit;;0;0;0;5;5;13;9;19;41

However, it is unknown These features of CA Whether change DEPENDING ON ITS stage of evolution. To address esta, in a well-established Animal model of CA we Studied the time course of electromyographic responses to electrical stimulation of C fibers (C-reflex), pain-like behavior as a response to mechanical nociceptive stimulation, and the inhibition of Both Responses by a prototypic opioid analgesic, morphine. To induce CA, rats received a single injection of complete Freund's adjuvant into the ankle joint and the C-reflex responses to electrical stimuli or the nociceptive response to paw pressure test Were Studied 2, 4 or 6 weeks later. The C-reflexes evoked by supra-threshold and threshold electrical stimulation exhibited progressive Increases Together with enhancement of the nociceptive behavior to mechanical stimulation During induction of monoarthritis. Notably, while systemic morphine antinociceptive effects produced upon experimental Both Approaches, the effects Were markedly reduced During the early stages of CA but at later stages enhanced. These data Indicate That C-reflex and pain-like responses evolve in parallel, and are inhibited by morphine in a stage-dependent manner through the induction of CA.

In order to better Understand the Molecular Mechanisms of chronic stress-triggered Mental disease, the effect of corticosterone (CORT) on the biology of AChRs was Studied in the neuronal cell line CNh. We found That CORT With chronic treatment reduced the expression levels of the neuronal-type a7 AChR and, to a lesser extent, of a4-AChR. CORT Also delayed the acquisition of the mature cell phenotype in CNh cells. Chronic nicotine treatment AFFECTED CNh the differentiation of cells and exerted a synergistic effect With CORT, suggesting AChRs That Could Participate in signaling pathways controlling That the cell cycle. Overexpression of a7 AChR-GFP-CORT abolished the effects on the cell cycle and the specific a7-AChR inhibitor, methyllycaconitine, mimicked the action exerted by CORT proliferative. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings Showed a significant decrease in nicotine-evoked currents in CORT-treated cells.

Conversely, chronic stress did not Affect the morphology of the PO (subserving auditory and somatosensory information Both) or the auditory and somatosensory correspondiente unconditioned responses (acoustic startle response and escape behavior). Our results Suggest That the auditory stimulus can be conditioned in part processed Independently of the IC and MG in the stressed animals, and sent to the amygdala via the PO inducing unconditioned fear.

594;1473;BDNF Regulates Rab11-Mediated Recycling Endosome Dynamics to Induce Dendritic Branching;Dendritic arborization of neurons is regulated by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) together With its receptor, TrkB. Endocytosis is required for dendritic branching and Regulates TrkB signaling, but how postendocytic Determines the neuronal trafficking response to BDNF is not well Understood. The monomeric GTPase Rab11 Regulates the dynamics of recycling endosomes Local and delivery of receptors to specific dendritic compartments. We Investigated Whether Rab11-dependent trafficking of TrkB in dendrites Regulates BDNF-induced rat hippocampal dendritic branching in neurons. We report That TrkB in dendrites is responsible for Rab11 Rab11 endosomes and That and Its Both effector, MyoVb, are required for BDNF / TrkB-induced dendritic branching. In Addition, BDNF induces the accumulation of Rab11-positive endosomes and GTP-bound Rab11 in dendrites and the expression of a constitutively active mutant of Rab11 is sufficient to Increase by dendritic branching dendrites Increasing TrkB and localization in sensitization to endogenous BDNF Enhancing. We propose That Rab11-dependent dendritic recycling Provides a mechanism to Retain TrkB in dendrites and to Increase Local signaling to Regulate arborization. © 2 the authors.;JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE;2013;Artículo;Neurosciences;0;dendrit;rab;trkb;bdnf;regul;;0;0;0;5;5;5;9;19;4
595;1541;Saccade-Related Modulations of Neuronal Excitability Support Synchrony of Visually Elicited Spikes;During natural vision, primates perform frequent saccadic eye movements, Allowing only a narrow time window for processing the visual information at each location. Individual Neurons May Contribute only with a few spikes to the visual processing During each fixation, suggesting spike timing required as a mechanism for Relevant information processing. We recently found in V1 of monkeys freely viewing images Natural, That fixation-related spike synchronization OCCURS at the early phase of the response rate after fixation-onset, suggesting a specific role of the first response spikes in V1. Here, we show That there are strong Local field potential (LFP) modulations locked to the onset of saccades, Which continue into the successive periods fixation. Visually induced spikes, in particular, the first spikes after the onset of a fixation, are locked to a specific epoch of the LFP modulation. We Suggest That the modulation of neural excitability, Which is Reflected by the saccade-related LFP changes, serves as a corollary signal enabling timing of spikes required in V1 and thereby providing a mechanism for spike synchronization. © 2011 The Author.;CEREBRAL CORTEX;2011;Artículo;Neurosciences;0;spike;fixat;lfp;modul;onset;;0;0;0;3;6;3;6;7;18

Well-Characterized Animal models of esta process are needed to clarify ITS underlying molecular Mechanisms, in Which the role of nitric oxide has-been a controversial component. We Have used kindling with a sub-convulsive dose of pentylenetetrazole to objectively characterize early electroencephalographic changes During epileptogenesis. We used electroencephalographic recordings Both During pentylenetetrazole (20 mg / kg) for 20 days kindling and Then, 24 days later to quantify the number, duration and spectral power of epileptic discharges. The levels of nitric oxide in the locally modulated Were cerebral cortex by pharmacological agents. The number of epileptiform discharges Increased During The kindling protocol as well as 24 days later, revealing the induction of a self-sustaining epileptogenic process. Epileptic discharges Were Characterized by theta frequencies (4-10 Hz) That Were associated With absence-like seizures. However, During kindling, the spectral power of the theta band Decreased progressively, while the power of higher frequencies, in the beta band, Increased. Nitric oxide in the cerebral cortex inhibited the number and amplitude of epileptic discharges. The electroencephalographic characterization of esta kindling protocol Provides a tool to detect Consequences of valuable therapeutic interventions Undertaken at initial phases of epileptogenesis, especially Those targeted towards stopping esta process.

597;1735;Structure of Excitatory Synapses and GABAA Receptor Localization at Inhibitory Synapses Are Regulated by Neuroplastin-65;Formation, maintenance, and activity of excitatory and inhibitory synapses are essential for neuronal network function. Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) are crucially Involved In These processes. The CAM neuroplastin-65 (NP65) During periods of Highly Expressed synapse formation and stabilization is present at the pre- and postsynaptic membranes. NP65 can translocate into synapses in response to electrical stimulation and it interacts With GABA A receptors subtypes of inhibitory synapses in. Here, we report That in the murine hippocampus and in hippocampal primary culture, CA1 neurons of the dentate gyrus region and the (DG) express high levels NP65, in CA3 neurons Whereas expression is lower. In neuroplastin-deficient (Np - / -) mice the number of excitatory synapses in CA1 and DG, but not CA3 regions is reduced. Notably this Picture is mirrored in mature Np - / - hippocampal cultures or in CA1 and DG mature wild-type (Np + / +) neurons Treated with a function-blocking recombinant extracellular NP65-Fc fragment. , Although the number of GABAergic synapses was unchanged in Np - / - neurons or in mature NP65-Fc-treated Np + / + neurons, the ratio of excitatory synapses was inhibitory to Significantly lower in Np - / - cultures. Furthermore, GABAA receptor composition was altered at inhibitory synapses in Np - / - neurons as the a1 to a2 GABA A receptor subunit ratio was Increased.

The condition results in altered electrical properties membrane (EMPs) of fetal neurons, Which are qualitatively identical to trisomy 16 fetal Those of mice (TS16), an Animal model of the human condition. Ts16 hippocampal neurons cultured reportedly exhibit Increased voltage-dependent calcium currents (ICa) amplitude. TS16 since animals are unviable, We Have immortalized cell lines established from the cerebral cortex of TS16 (named NCTB) and the normal littermates (named NHC). Using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique, We Have Studied now ICa in CTb and CNh cells. Current activation at -40 mV in OCCURS Both cell lines (Vholding = -80 mV). Trisomic cells exhibited 2.4 fold Increase in the maximal Ca2 + current density Compared to the normal cells (CNh = -6.3 ± 0.77 pA / pF, n = 18 CTb = -16.4 ± 2,423 pA / pF P & lt 0.01, n = 13) . Time dependent activation and inactivation kinetics for did not differ Between the two cell types. However, steady state inactivation studies revealed a 15 mV shift Toward more depolarized potentials in the trisomic condition, suggesting That altered voltage dependence of inactivation May underlie the Increased current density. Further, the overall charge movement across the membrane is Increased in CTb cells, in agreement With That by the potential sensitivity expected shift.

600;1987;Assessment of the Limits of Neural Phase-Locking Using Mass Potentials;In the diverse systems mechanosensory That animals evolved, the waveform of stimuli can be encoded by phase locking in spike trains of primary afferents. Coding of the fine structure of sounds via phase locking is thought to be critical for hearing. The upper frequency limit of phase locking varies across species and is unknown in humans. We applied a method developed Previously, Which is based on neural adaptation evoked by forward masking, to analyze mass potentials recorded on the cochlea and auditory nerve in the cat. The method Allows us to separate neural receptor potentials from phase locking. That we find the frequency limit of neural phase locking Obtained from mass potentials was very similar to That Reported for single auditory nerve fibers.

In contrast, the effect of ICH on the systemic immune system has barely Been Investigated. We Examined the effects of different hematoma volumes on immune cell subpopulations in murine experimental ICH. In C57BL / 6 mice, striatal ICH was induced by injection of autologous blood (10, 30 or 50 L). Control animals received the respective sham operation. Three days after ICH induction, differential blood leukocyte counting was performed. Lymphocyte subpopulations Were Characterized by flow cytometry further in blood, spleen, lymph node and thymus.

Here, we Investigated the participation of iron on calcium signal generation and ERK1 / 2 stimulation induced by the glutamate agonist Nmethyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), and the effects of iron Addition / chelation on hippocampal basal synaptic transmission and longterm potentiation (LTP) . Addition of NMDA to primary hippocampal cultures elicited persistent calcium signals NMDA receptors That required functional and independent of calcium Influx Were through L-type calcium channels or a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors Also Promoted NMDA ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation.

To gain further insight into changes in the These cerebral cortex, rats Were Treated With fluoxetine (FLX) for 4 weeks. These animals Showed Decreased anxiety and learned helplessness. N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) and a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA) receptor subunit levels (NR1, NR2A, NR2B, GluR1 and GluR2) Were analysed in the forebrain by Both Western blot of homogenates and immunohistochemistry. Both methods Demonstrated an upregulation of NR2A, GluR1 and GluR2 That was especially significant in the granular retrosplenial b cortex (RSGB). However, When analyzing subunit content in postsynaptic densities and synaptic membranes, we found Increases of NR2A and GluR2 but not GluR1.

One type of profile, Described originally as 'type 3', is different from That of nociceptors (type 1), cold afferents (type 2) and sympathetic efferents (type 4), in That These fibers display a minimal activity-dependent slowing ( ~ 1% at 2 Hz). However, Their function remains to be determined. Here we describe one unit with a typical 'type 3' activity-dependent slowing profile recorded from an undamaged surface fascicle of the peroneal nerve of a patient. Its conduction velocity was 1.8ms -1 and it Slowed by 1.3% During the 2 Hz tetanus. This unit had a mechanical receptive field in the hairy skin and Readily Responded to weak mechanical stimuli, and not to cold.

606;2571;Sniffing shapes the dynamics of olfactory bulb gamma oscillations in awake behaving rats;Actively mammals sample the environment for olfactory Relevant objects. This active sampling is revealed by rapid changes in respiratory rate That influence the olfactory input. Yet the role of sniffing in shaping the neural responses to odorants have not Been elucidated. In the olfactory bulb (OB), odorant-evoked gamma oscillations Reflect the synchronous activity of mitral / tufted cells, to proposed mechanism for odorant representation. Here we Examined the effect of frequency on the sniffing odorant-evoked gamma oscillations in the OB. Simultaneously we recorded the respiratory rate and the local field potential while the rats performed to lick / no-lick olfactory discrimination task With low odorant Concentrations. High-frequency sniffing (HFS) augmented the power of gamma oscillations, suggesting an Increase in the sensitivity to odorants. By contrast, coupling of the gamma oscillations to the sniff cycle and the amplitude of single bursts Were not modified by the respiratory rate. However, HFS prolonged the overall response to odorants and Increased the frequency of the gamma oscillations, indicating HFS That you reduce the adaptation to continuous odorant stimulation. THEREFORE, the Increase in gamma power is the result HFS During more frequent of gamma bursts and the extended response to odorants. As can be performed odorant discrimination in a single sniff, a reduction in the adaptation mediated by HFS of novel odorants May Facilitate odorant odorant memory formation for subsequent identification. Finally, These results corroborate That Olfactory sampling Should be integrated to the study of odorant coding in behaving animals. © 2011 The Authors.

These Ca2 + signals, Which emerges Within seconds after Addition iron, Arise Ca2 + release from mostly through the redox-sensitive ryanodine receptor (RyR) channels present in the endoplasmic reticulum. We Have Also Reported That Addition of amyloid-p synaptotoxic primary hippocampal neurons to oligomers Stimulates RyR-mediated Ca2 + release, generating long-lasting Ca2 + signals Ca2 + -sensitive That activate cellular effectors and Promote the disruption of the mitochondrial network. Here, we describe That 24 h incubation of primary hippocampal neurons with iron enhanced agonist-induced RyR-mediated Ca2 + release and Promoted mitochondrial network fragmentation in 43% of neurons, a response Significantly preventer by RyR inhibition and by the antioxidant agent N-acetyl- L-cysteine. Stimulation of RyR-mediated Ca2 + release by a RyR agonist Ca2 + uptake mitochondrial Promoted Control in neurons and in iron-treated neurons That non-fragmented mitochondria displayed, but not in neurons With fragmented mitochondria. Yet, the overall cytoplasmic Ca2 + Increase induced by the Ca2 + ionophore ionomycin the prompted significant mitochondrial Ca2 + uptake in neurons With fragmented mitochondria, indicating That fragmentation did not Prevent mitochondrial Ca2 + uptake but presumably Decreased the functional coupling Between RyR-mediated Ca2 + release and the mitochondrial Ca2 + uniporter .

The LFP oscillations Have Been Proposed That Facilitates mechanism as the synchronization of OB output neurons and the representation of a similar odorants. LFP gamma oscillations depend on the OB inhibitory network and early sensory deprivation modifies esta inhibitory network. However, little is Known About the LFP oscillations and neuronal discharge in the OB deprived. We Examined the mitral / tufted (MT) cells' oscillatory activity and LFP oscillations in sensory-deprived Both standard and OBs in Urethane Anesthetized rats. We found That MT cells in the normal and OBs deprived basal mean firing rate Have like 44% of the cells in deprived OB recorded and only 8% of the cells in the normal OB Showed firing rate modulation by odorants, Both exhibiting a ratio of excitatory Similar to inhibitory responses. A fraction of MT cells exhibited oscillatory discharge centered on gamma (60-70 Hz) and beta (20 Hz) frequencies, esta feature was not, Although dependent on consistently odorant stimulation. Decreased the LFP odorants oscillatory power in the gamma band (35-90 Hz) and the power Increased in the beta band (12-30 Hz). The modulation of LFP oscillations by odorants was predominant Also in the deprived (53%) Compared to Normal the OB (17%). In contrast, a higher fraction of MT cells' discharge was locked to the gamma LFP cycle in the usual OB. These results Suggest That early unilateral olfactory deprivation Increases the OB sensitivity to odorants and reduces the temporal synchrony Between activity and gamma unitary LFP oscillations without altering the basal neuronal discharge. © 2009 IBRO.;NEUROSCIENCE;2009;Artículo;Neurosciences;0;lfp;depriv;odor;oscil;discharg;;0;0;0;3;6;3;9;19;18

615;3189;Control of dopaminergic neuron survival by the unfolded protein response transcription factor XBP1;Parkinson's disease (PD) is Characterized by the selective loss of dopaminergic substantia nigra neurons of the pars compacta (SNpc). Evidence Indicates That, Although growing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a hallmark of PD, ITS exact contribution to the disease process is not well Understood. Here we report That developmental ablation of X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) in the nervous system, a key regulator of the unfolded protein response (UPR), dopaminergic neurons Protects against PD-inducing neurotoxin. This effect was associated survival with a preconditioning condition That Resulted from induction of an adaptive ER stress response in dopaminergic neurons of the SNpc, but not in other brain regions. In contrast, in adult animals XBP1 silencing triggered ER stress and chronic dopaminergic neuron degeneration. Supporting esta finding, gene therapy to deliver an active form of XBP1 provided neuroprotection and reduced striatal denervation in animals injected with 6-hydroxydopamine.

We Investigated here the effect of a reversible blockade of neostriatum on learning strategies Assessed by a cross maze paradigm, A × C Comparing (phenotypically similar to wild rats) versus Long-Evans rat strains. The rats Were trained to reach a consistently baited-arm (west arm), starting from the same arm (south arm). The learning strategy was EVALUATED at days 11 and 19, When Were test trials performed Placing the mouse in a box at the start-arm (north arm) opposite to the training That When starting, following a saline or lidocaine injection into the neostriatum.

618;3409;Cross-frequency interaction of the eye-movement related LFP signals in V1 of freely viewing monkeys;Recent studies the functional role emphasized Have of neuronal activity underlying Local oscillatory field potential (LFP) During visual processing signals in the natural conditions. While functionally Relevant components in multiple frequency bands Have Been Reported, little is Known About Whether and how These components Interact with each other across the dominant frequency bands. We Examined esta phenomenon in LFP signals Obtained from the primary visual cortex of monkeys performing saccadic eye movements on voluntary still images of the natural scenes. We Identified saccade-related changes in respect to power and phase in four dominant frequency bands: delta-theta (2-4 Hz), alpha-beta (10-13 Hz), low-gamma (20-40 Hz), and high -gamma (> 100 Hz). The phase of the delta-theta band component is found to be entrained to the rhythm of the repetitive saccades, while an increment in the power of the alpha-beta-gamma and low bands locked to the onset Were of saccades. The degree of the power modulation in frequency bands These is positively correlated With the degree of the phase-locking of the delta-theta oscillations to eye movements. These results Suggest the presence of cross-frequency interactions in the form of phase-amplitude coupling Between slow (delta-theta) and faster (alpha-beta and low gamma) oscillations. As shown Previously, spikes evoked by visual fixations During free viewing are phase-locked to the fast oscillations. THUS, signals of different types and at different temporal scales are nested to each other naturally During viewing. Such cross-frequency interaction May Provide general mechanism to coordinate sensory processing on a fast time scale and behavior engine on a slower time scale During active sensing. © 2 Ito, Maldonado and Gruen.;FRONTIERS IN SYSTEMS NEUROSCIENCE;2013;Artículo;Neurosciences;0;band;frequenc;phase;delta;gamma;;0;0;0;3;6;3;9;7;18

Calcium signals trigger post-synaptic pathways in hippocampal neurons underlie synaptic plasticity That, learning, and memory. Recent evidence supports a role of the RyR2 and RyR3 These isoforms in processes. Along with Calcium Signals factor brain-derived neurotrophic (BDNF) is a key signaling molecule for hippocampal synaptic plasticity and spatial memory. Upon binding to specific receptors TrkB, BDNF signaling pathways That Initiates complex structure and function modify Synaptic. Here, we show That BDNF-induced remodeling of hippocampal dendritic spines required functional RyR. Additionally, incubation With enhanced the expression of BDNF RyR2, RyR3, and PKM<U+03B6>, an atypical protein kinase Cisoform with key roles in hippocampal memory consolidation. Consistent With Their Increased RyR protein content, BDNF-treated neurons generated larger RyR-mediated calcium signals than controls. Selective inhibition of RyR-mediated calcium release inhibitory With the ryanodine Concentrations preventer PKM<U+03B6>, RyR2, and RyR3 protein content induced by BDNF enhancement. Intrahippocampal injection of BDNF or training rats in a spatial memory task PKM<U+03B6> enhanced, RyR2, RyR3, and hippocampal BDNF protein content, while injection of ryanodine at Concentrations That Stimulate RyR-mediated calcium release improved spatial learning and memory enhanced memory consolidation.

Recent evidence That Suggests, in Addition to STI classical role as a neurotransmitter, 5-HT neuronal connectivity Regulates During mammalian development by modulating cell migration and neuronal cytoarchitecture. Given the variety of 5-HTRs, Researchers Have had difficulty clarifying the specific role of each receptor subtype in brain development. Signaling mediated by the G-protein-coupled 5-HT1AR and 5-HT7R, however, you has-been associated neuronal plasticity With. THUS, we hypothesized That 5HT neurite outgrowth Promotes through 5-HT1AR and 5-HT7R. The Involvement of 5-HT1AR and 5-HT7R in the morphology of rat hippocampal neurons was EVALUATED by treating primary cultures at 2 days in vitro with 5-HT and specific antagonists for 5-HT1AR and 5-HT7R (WAY-100635 and SB-269970, respectively). The stimulation of hippocampal neurons with 100 nM 5-HT for 24 hr produced no effect on the number or the Either length of neurites primary. Nonetheless, after 5HT7R was blocked, the Addition of 5-HT Increased the number of primary neurites, suggesting 5HT7R That Could inhibit neuritogenesis.

622;3656;Activation of the unfolded protein response enhances motor recovery after spinal cord injury;Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a major cause of paralysis, and Involves multiple cellular and tissular responses Including demyelination, inflammation, cell death and axonal degeneration. Recent evidence That Suggests perturbation on the homeostasis of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is Observed in different SCI models however, the functional contribution of esta pathway to this pathology is not known. Here we Demonstrate That SCI ER stress triggers a fast reaction (1-3 h) Involving the upregulation of key components of the unfolded protein response (UPR), a process propagates through the That spinal cord. Ablation of X-box binding protein 1-(XBP1) or activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) expression, two major transcription factors UPR, leads to a reduced locomotor recovery after experimental SCI. The effects of UPR inactivation Were associated with a significant Increase in the number of damaged axons and reduced amount of oligodendrocytes surrounding the injury zone. In Addition, microglial activation and altered pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in ATF4 Were Observed after SCI deficient mice. Local expression of active XBP1 into the spinal cord using adeno-associated viruses enhanced locomotor recovery after SCI, and was an Associated With Increased number of oligodendrocytes. Altogether, our results Demonstrate a functional role of the UPR in SCI, offering novel therapeutic targets to treat esta invalidating condition. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

623;3671;A Perisynaptic Menage a Trois between Dlg, DLin-7, and Metro Controls Proper Organization of Drosophila Synaptic Junctions;Structural plasticity of synaptic junctions is a prerequisite to Achieve and nervous systems modulate Within connectivity, e.g., learning and memory formation During. It Demands adequate backup systems allow remodeling That while retaining sufficient stability to Prevent unwanted synaptic disintegration. The strength of submembranous scaffold complexes, Which are essential to the architecture of synaptic junctions, constitutes a crucial determinant likely of synaptic stability. Postsynaptic density-95 protein (PSD-95) / Discs-Large (DLG) -like membrane-associated guanylate kinases (DLG-MAGUKs) are main proteins At Both vertebrate and invertebrate synapses scaffold. At glutamatergic Drosophila larval neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) DLGA and DlgS97 exert pleiotropic functions, probably reflecting a few Known and to yet-unknown number of binding partners. In This study We Have Identified Metro, a novel p55 / MPP-like Drosophila MAGUK as a major binding partner of perisynaptic DlgS97 at larval NMJs. Based on Homotypic LIN-2, -7 (L27) domain interactions, stabilizes Metro junctional DlgS97 in a Complex with the highly conserved protein adapter DLIN-7. In a remarkably interdependent manner, Metro and DLIN-7 act downstream of DlgS97 to NMJ controlling expansion and proper establishment of synaptic boutons. Using quantitative 3D-imaging we further Demonstrate That the size of complex controls the postsynaptic glutamate receptor fields.

Contralateral acoustic stimulation activates the MOC efferent fibers uncrossed Cochlear reducing neural responses, THUS modifying the input to the Central auditory system. The chinchilla, Studied Among all mammals, displays the lowest percentage of uncrossed fibers raising MOC Questions about the strength and frequency distribution of the contralateral-sound effect in esta species. On the other hand, MOC effects on cochlear sensitivity mainly Have Been Studied in Anesthetized animals and since the MOC-neuron activity depends on the level of anesthesia, it is Important to ASSESS the influence of anesthesia in the strength of efferent effects. Seven adult chinchillas (Chinchilla laniger) Were chronically implanted electrodes with round-window in cochleae Both.

628;4395;Superposition Model Predicts EEG Occipital Activity during Free Viewing of Natural Scenes;Visual event-related potentials (ERPs) produced by a stimulus are thought to Reflect Either an Increase of synchronized activity or a phase realignment of ongoing oscillatory activity, with Both Mechanisms sharing the assumption That ERPs are independent of the current state of the brain at the time of stimulation. In viewing nature, however, visual inputs Occur one after another on at specific subject-paced intervals unconstrained through eye movements. We conjecture That naturally During viewing, ERPs generated after each fixation are better Explained by a superposition of ongoing oscillatory activity related to the processing of previous fixations, with new activity elicited by the visual input at the current fixation. We Examined the electroencephalography (EEG) signals That Occur in humans at the onset of each visual fixation, while Both subjects freely and naturally viewed scenes while a black or viewed They gray background.

547;391;Birth weight, current body mass index, and insulin sensitivity and secretion in young adults in two Latin American populations;Background and AIMS: Have studies shown, Although association of birth weight (BW) and adult body mass index (BMI) in Adults With insulin sensitivity, there is limited evidence BW That is Associated With insulin secretion. We Assessed the associations Between BW and current BMI With sensitivity and secretion insulin in young Latin American adults. Methods and results: Two birth cohorts, one from Ribeirao Preto, Brazil, based on participants aged 23-25 <U+200B><U+200B>years 1984, and another from Limache, Chile, based on 965 participants aged 22-28 years Were Studied. Weight and height at birth, and current plasma glucose and fasting insulin levels Were Measured. Insulin sensitivity (HOMA% S) and secretion (HOMA% ß) Were Estimated using the Homeostatic Model Assessment (HOMA2). Multiple linear regression analyzes Were Carried out to test the associations Between BW and adult BMI z-scores on log HOMA% S and log HOMA% ß. BW z score was associated With HOMA% S in the two Populations and HOMA% ß in Ribeirao Preto When adult BMI z score was included in the model. BW z score was associated With decreasing insulin secretion even without adjusting for adult BMI, but only in Ribeirao Preto. BMI z score was associated With HOMA% S low and high HOMA% ß. No interactions BW and BMI Between z-scores on insulin sensitivity Were shown. Conclusions: This study supports the finding That May Affect BW insulin sensitivity and secretion in young adults. The effect size of BW on insulin status is small in comparison to current BMI. © 2 Elsevier B.V. ..;NUTRITION METABOLISM AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES;2012;Artículo;Nutrition & dietetics;0;homa;insulin;bmi;adult;score;;0;0;0;15;3;16;3;21;45
548;400;Amerindian mtDNA Haplogroups and Celiac Disease Risk HLA Haplotypes in Mixed-blood Latin American Patients;Background and Objective: Risk haplotypes Have Been Described in celiac disease (CD), but the influence of native genes on CD in Hispanic Americans is unknown. The aim of the study was to measure the frequency of Amerindian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroups (inherited by the maternal line) in mixed-blood Patients with CD from Chile, Argentina, and Uruguay, and to ASSESS the relation Between These and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles and haplotypes and clinical presentations. Patients and Methods: Clinical history, histological data, and genetic studies Were Conducted following two protocols: a case-control study of 72 Chilean Patients with CD and controls, and an assessment of 43 (additional) samples of celiac Patients from Chile, 96 from Argentina, and 57 from Uruguay, Compared With the mtDNA frequency in the Corresponding country. HLA typing was performed by a commercial kit, and mtDNA was Determined by Means of polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphisms analysis. Results: A Total of 73.6% of cases ADH typical presentations. The most frequent HLA alleles HLA-DQB * Were 201 and 202. Non-DQ2 / DQ8 HLA haplotypes Were found in 7% of cases. mtDNA frequencies for typical Amerindian haplogroups Were found in 71% of cases and 64% of controls (P = 0.016 <U+03C7>) in the comparative analysis, mtDNA distribution was not different from the figures Reported for the respective country overall population. No relation was found haplotypes or haplogroups Between and clinical presentations. Conclusions: mtDNA haplogroups A / B / C / D found in celiac Were Frequently Patients and controls, but not relations Appeared Between haplogroups, haplotypes, and clinical presentations.

549;511;Changes in Bone Mineral Density After Sleeve Gastrectomy or Gastric Bypass: Relationships with Variations in Vitamin D, Ghrelin, and Adiponectin Levels;Background: A major long-term concern after gastric bypass (GBP) is the risk of osteoporosis however, little is Known about this complication Patients Undergoing in sleeve gastrectomy (SG). Objective: To Evaluate changes in bone mineral density (BMD) after GBP and SG, and Its Relationship With changes in vitamin D, parathyroid hormone (PTH), ghrelin, and adiponectin. Methods: Twenty-three women Undergoing GBP (BMI 42.0 ± 4.2 kg / m2 37.3 ± 8.1 years) and 20 Undergoing SG (BMI 37.3 ± 3.2 kg / m 2, 34.2 ± 10.2 years) Were Studied before and 6 and 12 months after surgery. BMD was Measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Plasma PTH, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25 OHD-), ghrelin, and adiponectin Concentrations Were determined. Food as well as calcium and vitamin D supplement intake was recorded. Results: Excess weight loss (mean ± SE), adjusted by baseline excess weight, was 79.1 ± 3.8% and 74.9 ± 4.1% after 1 year GBP and SG, respectively (p = 0.481). Significant reduction in BMD for the total body (TB), lumbar spine (LS) and femoral neck (FN) was Observed after GBP. In the SG group, reduction in BMD was significant only for TB. Adjusted by baseline BMD, the change in BMD Difference between for GBP vs. SG was not significant for TB, LS, or FN. Percent reduction in ghrelin concentration was a main factor related to the total BMD loss (GBP group) and LS BMD loss (GBP and SG groups). Conclusions: One year after gastric bypass, bone mineral density was AFFECTED Significantly, mainly at the femoral neck. Decreases in bone mineral density Were more dramatic Among Patients Who Had greater baseline BMD and greater reduction in ghrelin Concentrations. © 2014 Springer Science + Business Media New York.;OBESITY SURGERY;2014;Artículo;Nutrition & dietetics;0;bmd;gbp;ghrelin;reduct;baselin;;0;0;0;12;3;12;3;21;16

551;598;Does Chile's nutritional situation constitute a double burden?;Background: Chile has probably experienced Latin America's fastest nutritional transition, as evidenced by very low rates of stunting, but the country shows a high prevalence of obesity in population MOST groups.Objective: The aim was to ASSESS the existence of a double burden of nutritional problems in Chile on the basis of available data.Design: Secondary Analyzes Were Conducted on Data Collected by the Health Ministry (height and weight for children aged 6 and and for adults aged> 65 y), the Education Ministry (height and weight in the first year of primary school and the first year of high school), the 2003 and 2009-2 National Health Surveys [body mass index (BMI) and prevalence anemia], the 2-2011 National Food consumption Survey (ENCA, food consumption, height, and weight), and a Food Insecurity Survey of elderly adults (aged 65-74 y) in Santiago (height, weight, and food insecurity) .results: in 2011 the prevalence of stunting (height-for-age, 22 z scores) was 1.9% for chil drain, 6 and old and 3.6% Among children in the first year of primary school. This situation was in contrast with a high prevalence of obesity in children (22.1% of children in the first year of primary school BMI> 2 z scores) and Among adults, especially women, with age increase increasing (44.8% of women 45-64 old and had a BMI> 30 kg / m2). The prevalence of anemia in women aged 15-64 and was low (5.1%). In the ENCA survey, women Showed a high prevalence of below-average intakes of vitamin A, vitamin B-12, vitamin C, calcium, and zinc, irrespective of BMI. Elderly persons WHO Were Those Who Were underweight and obese had a greater perception of food Significantly insecurity in relation to Those with a standard weight (61%, 50%, and 33%, respectively) .Conclusions: The data Showed high rates of obesity With very low frequency of stunting and, more information is needed, Although, the double burden of malnutrition probably does not exist in Chile, unlike in other Countries in the region. Among specific groups there are low intakes of food insecurity and critical utrients.

553;668;Age of menarche and nutritional status of indigenous and non-indigenous adolescents in the Araucania Region of Chile;Background: Early onset of menarche has-been linked to prevalence of obesity however, This May Differ for indigenous females. Objective: To analyze the relationship Between age of menarche and nutritional status Among non-indigenous and indigenous girls. Method: The design of esta study was cross-sectional. Date of menarche was determined to through interviews, and all responses Were confirmed by the girls' mothers. A total number of 8504 adolescents Were screened for recent menarche. One hundred and thirty-one girls of Mapuche (indigenous) and 143 girls of ChileanSpanish background and EVALUATED Were Identified by anthropometric measurements. Results: Median age of menarche was 150 months, interquartile range (IR) 143-157 in indigenous, and 145.5 months, IR 139,153 in non-indigenous girls (p = 0.04). The indigenous females Showed a higher prevalence of overweight (36.4% vs 23.1%), Although the frequency of obesity was like (16.8% vs 16.3%). For indigenous girls, age of menarche was delayed by 2.69 months (confidence intervals (CI) - 0.38 to 5.77). It was Observed That girls with age of menarche overweight experienced 7.59 months Earlier Than Those With regular weight, CI -4.41 -10.78 to. In the analysis of obesity, the effect on age of menarche was like, with 7.53 months Earlier onset than for the standard weight, CI -11.34 to -3.72.

554;696;Changes in Bone Mineral Density, Body Composition and Adiponectin Levels in Morbidly Obese Patients after Bariatric Surgery;Background: Gastric bypass surgery (GBP) is increasingly used as a treatment option in morbid obesity. Little is Known About the effects of esta surgery on bone mineral density (BMD) and the underlying Mechanisms. To evaluate- changes on BMD after GBP and Its relation With changes in body composition and serum adiponectin, a longitudinal study in obese subjects was Conducted morbid. Methods: Forty-two women (BMI 45.0 ± 4.3 kg / m 2, 37.7 ± 9.6 years) before surgery and Studied Were 6 and 12 months after GBP. Percentage of body fat (% BF), fat-free mass (FFM), and BMD Were Measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and serum adiponectin levels by RIA. Results: Twelve months after, GBP weight was 34.4 ± 6.5 Decreased by excess weight loss% and was 68.2 ± 12.8%. Significant reduction (p & lt 0.001) in the total BMD (-3.0 ± 2.1%), spine BMD (-7.4 ± 6.8%) and hip BMD (-10.5 ± 5.6%) Were Observed. Increased adiponectin concentration from 11.4 ± 0.7 mg / L before surgery to 15.7 ± 0.7 and 19.8 ± 1.0 at the sixth and twelfth month after GBP, respectively (p & lt 0.001). Thirty-seven percent of the variation in the total BMD Could Be Explained by baseline weight, initial BMD, BF reduction, and at the twelfth month adiponectin (r 2 = 0.373 p & lt 0.001). Adiponectin at the twelfth month had a significant and positive correlation With the reduction of BMD, unrelated to baseline and variation in body composition parameters (adjusted correlation coefficient: r = 0.36). Conclusion: GBP induces a significant BMD loss related with changes in body composition, metabolic, Although some Mediators, Such as adiponectin Increase, May Have an independent action on BMD Which deserves further study. © 2008 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.;OBESITY SURGERY;2009;Artículo;Nutrition & dietetics;0;bmd;adiponectin;gbp;bodi;surgeri;;0;0;0;12;3;12;3;21;16
555;753;Obesity indicators and cardiometabolic status in 4-y-old children;Background: In adults and adolescents, obesity is positively associated cardiovascular disease risk factors With However, evidence is scarce in preschool children. Objective: The objective was to ASSESS the Relations Between obesity and cardiometabolic risk factors indicators in 324 Chilean children 4 and of age. Design: We Collected anthropometric measurements and generally Calculated indicators of obesity [weight, body mass index (BMI), sum of 4 skinfold thicknesses, percentage fat, and body fat index] and central obesity (waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, waist-to-height ratio, and truncal fatness based on skinfold thickness). We Measured blood sample Concentrations of C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, triglycerides, and total LDL, and HDL cholesterol. We used multiple linear correlation and regression analyzes. Results: The prevalence of obesity (BMI-for-age z score> 2, World Health Organization 2006), central obesity (=90th percentile, third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey), and lipid disorders was high (13%, 11% , and = 20%, respectively), and 70% of the children ADH at least one cardiometabolic risk factor. Most Correlations Between Central obesity and obesity moderate to strong indicators Were (0.40 <r <0.96). Obesity was positively but weakly associated with C-reactive protein in Both sexes and homeostasis model assessment of With insulin resistance only in girls (all r <0.3, P <0.05). Were unrelated to obesity indicators interleukin-6 and Lipid Concentrations (P> 0.05). Overall, obesity indicators Explained, at most, 8% of the variability in cardiometabolic risk factors. Conclusions: Obesity and obesity Central Were common, and MOST of the children ADH At least one cardiometabolic risk factor, lipid disorders Particularly. Central obesity and obesity indicators Were highly intercorrelated and, overall, Were weakly related to cardiometabolic status. At this age, body mass index and waist circumference Were poor predictors of cardiometabolic status. © 2 American Society for Nutrition.;AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NUTRITION;2010;Artículo;Nutrition & dietetics;0;obes;cardiometabol;indic;central;factor;;0;0;0;15;3;16;3;21;45
556;767;Obesity is positively associated with dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate concentrations at 7 y in Chilean children of normal birth weight;Background: In low-birth-weight girls, the risk of obesity Increases premature adrenarche and metabolic complications. However, the consistency of esta association in the normal-birth-weight children and Its potential Mediators REMAIN unknown. Objectives: The Objectives Were to ASSESS the associations Between Obesity and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate indicators (DHEAS) at 7 and of age and to Evaluate the role of hormonal markers on These associations. Design: We Assessed in 969 participants (6.9 and 48% girls all Tanner I) in the Growth and Obesity Chilean Cohort Study the associations Between DHEAS and weight, BMI, waist circumference (WC), waist-to-height ratio, skinfold thickness, and the total percentage fat (bioimpedance) and determined to Were Whether These associations related to insulin, insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), and leptin. We Also Compared BMI and height growth from 0 to 7 and of age in nonobese and obese Children with standard and high DHEAS (=75th percentile) at 7 and. Results: Concentrations Were Similar Between DHEAS girls (30.3 61.86 mg / dL) and boys (29.4 ± 1.73 mg / dL) (P> 0.05) 17.3% of children Were obese (BMI-for-age z score =2 SD). Were adiposity indicators positively and similarly associated With DHEAS [ie BMI, ß standardized regression coefficient: 0.23 (95% CI: 0.17, 0.29) WC, ß standardized regression coefficient: 0.23 (95% CI: 0.16, 0.30)] These associations Were only partially related to IGF-I and leptin. Obese children ADH twice the risk of high DHEAS (OR: 2.16 95% CI: 1.51, 3.09) at 7, and obese Children with high DHEAS Were fatter and more obese than Their Counterparts Centrally (P <0.05), Although Their previous growth was similar (P> 0.05).

558;810;Trace Element Status and Inflammation Parameters after 6 Months of Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass;Background: Knowledge About the Practical Consequences of the nutritional status of Fe, Zn, and Cu and inflammation in obesity is limited. The objective of esta study was to Evaluate changes on trace element status and Their Associations With selected potential inflammation parameters in Patients after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP). Methods: Sixty-three women (mean age 36.9 ± 9.2 years, body mass index 43.8 ± 4.3 kg / m 2) Were EVALUATED at baseline and 6 months after RYGBP. Anthropometric (weight, waist circumference), body composition (fat mass and fat-free mass), dietary (nutrient intakes), and metabolic and inflammation (glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, adiponectin, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides , hs-CRP, leukocytes, polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN)) Were Determined parameters in Addition to selected indices of Fe, Zn, and Cu status. Results: All but one (HDL-cholesterol) and inflammation metabolic parameters HAD significant Differences before and after When Compared RYGBP. Hemoglobin, serum ferritin, the size of the Rapidly exchangeable zinc pool, and plasma copper Decreased after RYGBP. Plasma zinc and hair, as well as zinc protoporphyrin Increased. The change in Hb was associated Significantly (p & lt 0.05) to the change in leukocytes (r = 0.33) and adiponectin (r = -0.44). Zinc protoporphyrin change was associated to the change in PMN (r = 0.32) and HDL-cholesterol (r = -0.29). No other associations Between the changes of the rest of Fe, Zn, and Cu parameters With the changes of any of the metabolic and inflammation parameters Were Observed.

559;815;Evolution of the nutritional situation of indigenous and non-indigenous Chilean schoolchildren;Background: Latin American Countries show accelerated but ethnically or socially Their Differentiated changes in epidemiological profiles. Aim: The present study Examined the evolution of the nutritional situation (19972005) in Chilean schoolchildren as related to ethnical origin (Mapuche). Subjects and methods: Using official databases, stunting (height / age = - 2 z-scores), undernutrition (body mass index (BMI) = - 2 z-scores) and obesity (BMI =95 percentile) Were ascribed in first-grade schoolchildren. Were ethnic groups Assigned by native parents' surnames (none, one and two). Results: Based on 1,757,155 children (average age: 76.3 months), in 1997 8.4% stunting Reached, 4.8% and 3.1% in children with two, one and no Mapuche surnames, respectively. In 2005 it fell to 3.7%, 3.1% and 2.6% to marked decrease in Those with two Mapuche surnames (p <0.001). Obesity in 1997 was 11.8%, 12.8% and 13.3%, in 2005 it Whilst changed to 17.5, 18.5 and 18.6%, respectively, demonstrating a similar trend to obesity in all groups to (p = 0.153). Undernutrition was rare (<1.1%) and stable. Clearly Decreased Poverty Among the Mapuche population in esta period. Conclusion: The marked decrease in stunting in children with a strong indigenous background Seems related to a decrease in poverty over the period. Yet, the Increase of obesity in all groups deserves further analysis. © 2009 Informa UK Ltd.;ANNALS OF HUMAN BIOLOGY;2009;Artículo;Nutrition & dietetics;0;decreas;mapuch;obes;children;ethnic;children;177;0;0.0392635314995563;15;3;16;3;21;45

Were then a Repeated measurements every 5 minutes Until the spirit HAD Been completely eliminated from the bloodstream. During the period postoperatory (median of 2.3 months), the measurement was Repeated dose With the overall per kg adjusted to the new water body mass. The results Were Measured with a nonparametric analysis for Repeated samples. Results: The average maximum peak of the Alcotest was 2.02 g / l During the postoperative period Compared To 0.87 g / l During the preoperative period (p = 0.001 Wilcoxon). At 175 minutes, the blood alcohol level value Reaches zero (0) in all pre-operatory Patients, while after surgery, an average value of 0.26 g / l was Observed (Wilcoxon p = .027). After 4 h, an average of Alcotest® 0.20 g / l was Observed In These patients. Conclusion: Alcohol absorption was modified after LSG With Considerably higher and longer blood alcohol values <U+200B><U+200B>for equivalent Amounts of alcohol. © 2 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.;OBESITY SURGERY;2010;Artículo;Nutrition & dietetics;0;alcohol;measur;valu;absorpt;alcotest;;0;0;0;11;7;11;2;21;16
562;1034;Heme- and nonheme-iron absorption and iron status 12 mo after sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in morbidly obese women;Background: The effect of bariatric surgery on iron absorption is only partially known. Objective: The objective was to study the effects of sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) on heme- and nonheme-iron absorption and iron status. Design: Fifty-eight menstruating women enrolled in esta Were prospective study [mean (± SD) age: 35.9 ± 9.1 and weight: 101.7 ± 13.5 kg BMI (in kg / m2) 39.9 ± 4.4]. Anthropometric, body-composition, dietary, and hematologic indexes and heme- and nonheme-iron absorption - using a meal standardized container containing 3 mg Fe - Were Determined before and 12 mo after surgery. Forty-three subjects completed the 12-mo follow-up. Iron supplements Were strictly controlled. Results: Heme-iron absorption was 23.9% before and 6.2% 12 mo after surgery (P <0.0001). Nonheme-iron absorption from 11.1% to Decreased 4.7% (P <0.0001). No Differences Were Observed by type of surgery. Iron intakes from all sources of ± 6.2 27.9 supplements Were mg / d in the SG group and 63.2 ± 21.1 mg / d in the RYGBP group (P <0.001). Serum ferritin and total body iron Decreased after more than RYGBP after SG. Conclusions: Iron (heme and nonheme) absorption is markedly reduced after SG and RYGBP. The magnitude of the decrease in heme-iron absorption is greater than nonheme iron That of.

563;1329;Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid Composition of Maternal Diet and Erythrocyte Phospholipid Status in Chilean Pregnant Women;Characterized by Chilean diets are to low supply of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA), Which are critical nutrients and lactation During Pregnancy, Because of Their role in brain and visual development. DHA is the MOST Relevant n-3 PUFA in esta period. We EVALUATED the dietary n-3 PUFA intake and erythrocyte phospholipids n-3 PUFA in pregnant women Chilean. Eighty healthy pregnant women (20-36 years old) in the 3rd-6th month of pregnancy Were included in the study. Dietary assessment was done Applying a food frequency questionnaire, and data Were Analyzed SQL® through the Food Processor software. Fatty acids of erythrocyte phospholipids Were Assessed by gas-liquid chromatography. Diet composition was high in saturated fat, low in mono- and PUFA, high in n-6 PUFA (linoleic acid) and low in n-3 PUFA (alpha-linolenic acid and DHA), with imbalance in the n-6 / n -3 PUFA ratio. Similar results Were Observed for erythrocyte fatty acids from phospholipids. The sample of women pregnant Chilean Showed high consumption of saturated fat and low consumption of n-3 PUFA, Which is Reflected in the low erythrocyte DHA content of phospholipids. Imbalance Between n-6 / n-3 PUFA fetal development Could Affect negatively. New strategies are Necessary to Improve n-3 PUFA intake and breast feeding Throughout pregnancy periods. Furthermore, it is Necessary to Develop dietary interventions to Improve the quality of foods consumed With emphasis on individual n-3 PUFA. © 2014 by the authors licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.;NUTRIENTS;2014;Artículo;Nutrition & dietetics;0;pufa;acid;low;erythrocyt;phospholipid;acid;47;17;0.0104259094942325;2;6;2;10;17;40

565;1555;Affective style and eating disorders: A field study;Eating disorders (ED) are a heterogeneous group of problems related to restraint and / or overeating. That It Is Proposed Individual Differences in Affective reactivity and Moods (Affective style) Might be related to These Behaviors. Variations in affective style are Expressed by differing levels of sensitivity to the motivation systems of approach and avoidance. The present study tested a relation exists Whether Between ED and variations in the sensitivity of motivational systems as well as mood dispositions. A Total of 2020 undergraduate students completed the Eating Disorder Diagnostic Scale (EDDS), the Behavioral Inhibition System and Behavioral Activation System Scales (BIS / BAS), and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). The results Showed to significant within-subject interaction of Alimentary group x Motivation (F = 4.056 p <.007). It was Present Observed That the group Overeating lower levels of motivation ADH than the Normal Asymmetry (p <0.01) and Restrictive (p <0.005) groups and marginally lower levels than the Purgative group (p <0.07).

566;1728;Optimal information in authentication of food and beverages;Food and beverage authentication is the process by Which food or beverages are verified as Their label Complying with descriptions (Winterhalter, 2007). A common way to Deal with an authentication process is to measure attributes, Such as, groups of chemical compounds on samples of food, and then a use as input for a These classification method. In May there be many applications Several types of measurable attributes. An Important problem THUS Consist of Determining Which of these would Provide the best information, in the sense of Achieving the highest possible classification accuracy at low cost. We approach the problem under a decision theoretic strategy, by framing it as the selection of an optimal test (Geisser and Johnson, 1992) or as the optimal dichotomization of screening variables tests (Wang and Geisser, 2005), Where the 'test' is defined through a classification model applied to different groups of chemical compounds. The Proposed methodology is motivated by data Consisting of measurements of 19 chemical compounds (anthocyanins, flavonols and Organic Acids) on samples of Chilean red wines. The main goal is to determine the combination of chemical compounds That Provides the best information for authentication of wine varieties, Considering the losses associated to wrong decisions and the cost of the chemical analysis.

567;1786;Communicating about eating behaviors. A qualitative study of Chilean women and their health-care providers;Good Communication between health care providers (HCPs) and is critical in Patients Achieving positive health outcomes. The purpose of this article was to compare the perceptions of Chilean Woman and their HCPs With respect to determinants of eating behaviors. Semi-structured interviews Were Conducted With Women (n = 15) visiting a public health care center in Chile and With Their HCPs (n = 8) who Were in charge of Promoting healthy eating behaviors Among women. Data from the interviews Indicated similarities and inconsistencies in determinants of eating behaviors Between the groups. Both Mentioned That many Important factors influence women's eating behaviors, Including food preferences, dietary knowledge, self-monitoring and self-efficacy, family, food cost, and food availability. HCPs Appeared to be less aware of the role personality traits and past That play experiences as potential determinants Which Mentioned women. In contrast, women Were less aware of the influence of anxiety and low self-esteem on eating choices, Which NOTED HCPs as key factors. , Although it was encouraging to see women and Their agreement Between HCPs in some areas, it is Important to work on Increasing understanding Among the groups With respect to the Important Role in Influencing psychological factors play eating behavior. We Suggest That HCPs Should Focus on the Importance of women's personality traits and past eating behaviors, as well as work on Improving women's self-esteem and helping to decrease Their anxiety levels. HCPs Should be Encouraged to Develop Good Communication with each person in order to help them roles Understand the external and internal factors That play in eating behaviors. © 2015 P.

569;2065;Insulin-Dependent H2O2 Production Is Higher in Muscle Fibers of Mice Fed with a High-Fat Diet;Insulin resistance is defined as a reduced ability of insulin to Stimulate glucose utilization. C57BL / 6 mice fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) are a model of insulin resistance. In skeletal muscle, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) produced by NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) is Involved in signaling pathways triggered by insulin. We EVALUATED oxidative status in skeletal muscle fibers from insulin-resistant and control mice by H2O2 Determining generation (Hyper probe), reduced-to-oxidized glutathione ratio and NOX2 expression. After eight weeks of HFD, insulin-dependent glucose uptake in skeletal muscle was impaired fibers Compared With Control When muscle fibers. Insulin-resistant mice Showed Increased insulin-stimulated H2O2 release and Decreased reduced-to-oxidized glutathione ratio (GSH / GSSG). In Addition, p47phox and gp91phox (NOX2 subunits) mRNA levels Were Present high (~ 3-fold in mice HFD controls Compared To), while protein levels 6.8- and 1.6-Were fold higher, respectively. Using apocynin (NOX2 inhibitor) During the HFD feeding period, the intracellular oxidative environment and skeletal muscle was diminished insulin-dependent glucose uptake restored.

570;2707;Prevention of liver steatosis through fish oil supplementation: correlation of oxidative stress with insulin resistance and liver fatty acid content;Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is triggered by a nutritional-metabolic alteration Characterized by triacylglicerides acumulation, insulin resistance (IR), oxidative stress and depletion of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA). The n-3 PUFA, eicosapentaenoic Such as (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids, would be the development of hepatoprotective against NAFLD by stimulating lipolysis and lipogenesis inhibit. So, fish oil supplementation (EPA + DHA) Prevents HFD-induced NAFLD. In This context, the aim of esta study is to Evaluate the Correlation between oxidative stress liver With IR and levels of PUFA in Supplemented mice. Male mice C57BL / 6J (n = 9) Were fed for 12th week: a) Control diet (20% protein, 70% carbohydrate, 10% lipids), b) Control diet and fish oil supplementation (200 mg EPA + DHA / kg / day), c) high fat diet (20% protein, 20% carbohydrate, 60% lipids), and d) high fat diet and fish oil supplementation. Liver steatosis (histology), insulin resistance (HOMA), oxidative stress liver (GSH / GSSG, and protein carbonyl -isoprostanes 8) and liver fatty acid content Were EVALUATED. The significant decrease in oxidative stress liver parameters (p <0.05, ANOVA followed by Newman Keuls test) Were correlated (Pearson test) With HOMA and levels of PUFA, Along With the hepatoprotection Observed.

573;2807;Incremental replacement of saturated fats by n-3 fatty acids in high-fat, high-cholesterol diets reduces elevated plasma lipid levels and arterial lipoprotein lipase, macrophages and atherosclerosis in LDLR-/- mice;Objective: Effects of progressive substitution of dietary n-3 fatty acids (FA) for saturated FA (SAT) on risk factors for atherosclerosis modulating Have Been not fully defined. Our previous reports Demonstrate That SAT Increased, but n-3 FA Decreased arterial lipoprotein lipase (LPL) LDL levels and blood-cholesterol in atherogenesis early deposition. We now Questioned Increases in incremental Whether dietary n-3 FA can counteract SAT-induced pro-atherogenic effects in atherosclerosis-prone LDL-receptor knockout (LDLR - / -) mice and Have Identified contributing Mechanisms. Methods and results: Mice Were fed high-fat chow or diets enriched in SAT, n-3, or a combination of Both SAT and n-3 in ratios of 3: 1 (S :. n-3 3: 1) or 1 : 1 (n-3 S :. 1: 1). Each diet Resulted in the expected changes in fatty acid composition in blood and aorta for each feeding group. SAT-fed hyperlipidemic mice Became. By contrast, n-3 plasma lipid levels Decreased inclusion, especially cholesterol. LpL and macrophage blood levels over 2-Were Increased SAT-fold in mice fed but These Were Decreased With incremental replacement With n-3 FA. n-3 FA partial inclusion of markedly Decreased expression pro-inflammatory markers (CD68, IL-6, and VCAM-1) in aorta. SAT advanced atherosclerotic lesion diets accelerated development, all Whereas n-3 FA-container containing diets markedly Slowed atherosclerotic progression. Conclusion: Mechanisms whereby dietary n-3 FA May Improve adverse cardiovascular effects of high-SAT, high-fat diets plasma lipid profiles include Improving, Increasing Amounts of n-3 FA in plasma and the arterial wall. Even low levels of replacement of SAT by n-3 FA Effectively reduces arterial lipid deposition by decreasing aortic LpL, macrophages and pro-inflammatory markers. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.;ATHEROSCLEROSIS;2014;Artículo;Nutrition & dietetics;0;sat;decreas;diet;mice;arteri;;0;0;0;13;6;13;8;17;19
574;2809;Changes in ghrelin concentrations one year after resective and non-resective gastric bypass: Associations with weight loss and energy and macronutrient intakes;Objective: Ghrelin is a potent stimulator of appetite and synthesized in the stomach. Its role in weight loss after gastric bypass (GBP) is still controversial. The aim of esta study was to Evaluate the relation Between weight loss and food intake and Between weight loss and changes in serum ghrelin Concentrations 1 and after GBP With resection of the bypassed stomach (R-GBP) and without resection (NR-GBP). Methods: Of 50 women (37.6 ± 10.2 and old, body mass index 43.8 ± 4.8 kg / m 2) With GBP, R-26 ADH ADH GBP 24 and NR-GBP. Body weight, body composition (dual energy x-ray absorptiometry), food intake, and serum ghrelin at baseline and after 12 mo GBP Were Measured. Results: The percentage of excess weight loss was 68.9 ± 12.8% at 12 mo after GBP. At 12 m, the decrease of serum ghrelin was greater in the group R-GBP (-25.3 ± 5.22%) Compared With the NR-GBP group (+11.2 ± 50.9%, P & lt .005). After adjustment by the body weight excess of baseline, there was a greater percentage of excess weight loss in the group R-GBP only at 6 m (61.8% versus 54.9%, P = 0.011). After controlling for the baseline intake at significant lower carbohydrate intake was Observed in the R-GBP 6 mo after surgery group (P & lt 0.05). Conclusion: A greater decrease in ghrelin levels was only Observed in Patients underwent WHO R-GBP at 12 mo after surgery. This difference was not associated With Differences in dietary intakes or weight loss at the same time point. THEREFORE, the small gastric pouch is probably more than Decreased Important ghrelin levels in producing long-term weight loss after R-GBP. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.;NUTRITION;2012;Artículo;Nutrition & dietetics;0;gbp;weight;loss;ghrelin;intak;;0;0;0;12;3;12;3;21;16
575;3009;Adherence to a physical activity intervention among older adults in a post-transitional middle income country: A quantitative and qualitative analysis;Objectives: The effectiveness of community level interventions depends to a great extent on adherence. Currently, information on factors related to adherence in older adults from Developing Countries is scarce. Our aim was to identify identity factors associated to adherence to a physical activity in older adults intervention from a transitional post-middle income country. Design, setting and participants: Using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods we Studied 996 Chilean older subjects (65-67.9 years at baseline) With low to medium socioeconomic status from 10 health centers randomized to receive a physical activity intervention as part of the CENEX trial cluster (ISRCTN48153354). Measurements: Using a multilevel regression model, the relationship Between adherence (defined a priori as attendance at a minimum of 24 physical activity classes spread over 12 months at Least) and individually, intervention-related and contextual factors was EVALUATED. We Also Conducted 40 semi-structured interviews with older adults (n = 36) and instructors (n = 4). Transcripts of the interviews Were Analyzed using content analysis to Identify barriers and facilitators to adherence. Results: Adherence to physical activity was 42.6% intervention (95% CI 39.5 to 45.6). Depression, diabetes mellitus, percentage of impoverished Households and rate of arrests for violent crimes in the neighborhood Predicted less adherence (p <0.05) while being retired, participation in physical prior activity to the intervention, and green areas per habitant Were positively associated With adherence (p <0.05). The qualitative interviews Identified three primary barriers to adherence: current health problems, lack of time due to Commitments for caring for family members, and being employed, and two primary facilitators to adherence: the Health Benefits Attributed to the intervention and the opportunity the classes provided for social interaction with others.

577;3421;Role of Skeletal Muscle Mitochondrial Density on Exercise-Stimulated Lipid Oxidation;Reduced skeletal muscle mitochondrial density is to lead to impaired Proposed muscle lipid oxidation and Increased lipid accumulation in sedentary Individuals. We Assessed exercise-stimulated lipid oxidation by imposing a prolonged moderate-intensity exercise in men with varying skeletal muscle mitochondrial density as Measured by citrate synthase (CS) activity. After a 2-day isoenergetic high-fat diet, lipid oxidation was Measured before and During exercise (650 kcal at 50% VO2 max) in 20 healthy men with Either high (HI-CS = 24 ± 1 mean ± se) or low (LO-CS = 17 ± 1 nmol / min / mg protein) CS muscle activity. Vastus lateralis muscle biopsies before and Were Obtained Immediately after exercise. Respiratory exchange data and blood samples Were Collected at rest and Throughout the exercise. HI-CS subjects HAD higher VO2max (50 ± 1 vs 44 ± 2 ml / kg fat free mass / min P = 0.01), lower fasting respiratory quotient (RQ) (0.81 ± 0.01 vs. 0.85 ± 0.01 P = 0.04) and higher ex vivo muscle palmitate oxidation (866 ± 168 vs. 482 ± 78 nmol / h / mg muscle P = 0.05) Compared to LO-CS Individuals. However, whole-body exercise-stimulated lipid oxidation (20 ± 2 g vs. 19 ± 1 g P = 0.65) and plasma glucose, lactate, insulin, and catecholamine responses Were the two groups like Between. In conclusion, in response to the same energy demand to moderate During prolonged exercise bout, reliance on lipid oxidation was like in Individuals with high and low skeletal muscle mitochondrial density. This data Suggests That Decreased muscle mitochondrial density May Not Necessarily reliance on lipid oxidation impair over the course of the day since it was usual under a high-lipid oxidative demand condition.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats receiving fish oil (300mg / kg) for 3 days followed by intraperitoneal dose of 0.05 mg single T3 / kg Were subjected to 1 h of ischemia followed by 20 h of reperfusion. Parameters of liver injury (transaminases serum, histology) and oxidative stress (liver contents of GSH and oxidized proteins) Were correlated With fatty acid composition, NF-KB activity, and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and haptoglobin expression. Significantly modified IR liver histology serum transaminases enhanced, TNF-a or liver oxidative stress response Decreased liver and NF-kB activity and haptoglobin expression. , Although IR injury was not preventer by Either n-3 PUFA supplementation or T3 administration, substantial decrease in liver injury and oxidative stress was Achieved by the combined protocol, Which Present led to Increased liver n-3 PUFA content and Decreased n-6 <U+200B><U+200B>/ n -3 PUFA ratios, with recovery of NF-kB activity and TNF-a and haptoglobin expression. Prevention of liver IR injury by a protocol Achieved combined of T3 and n-3 PUFA supplementation May Represent a novel noninvasive clinical preconditioning strategy with potential application. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.;JOURNAL OF NUTRITIONAL BIOCHEMISTRY;2012;Artículo;Nutrition & dietetics;0;liver;injuri;pufa;oxid;prevent;;0;0;0;2;5;18;9;17;32
579;4003;Quality of the diet of women with severe and morbid obesity undergoing gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy;The objective of esta study was to Evaluate the changes of dietary intake and quality of the diet in Patients Undergoing gastric bypass and sleeve surgery. In 36 Women with severe and it was Assessed morbid obesity Their nutrient intakes and dietary quality before and 6 months after surgery through three-bariatric day food records. Vitamin and mineral supplements from intakes Were strictly controlled.

494;424;Effect of oral administration of a continuous 18 day regimen of meloxicam on ovulation: experience of a randomized controlled trial;Background Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is Expressed in all female reproductive organs. THEREFORE, inhibitors of COX-2 May Affect reproductive function. We EVALUATED the effect of extended administration of meloxicam on ovulation and the menstrual cycle. Our hypothesis was administered meloxicam That day menstrual cycle from 5- 22 Could interfere With follicular rupture, without disrupting the menstrual cycle, and Could be a non-hormonal contraceptive method potential. Methods The study was Conducted in 56 healthy women sterilized. Before the onset of treatment and after the end of treatment, participants Were Observed During a monitoring cycle to Ensure That They Had progesterone (P4) serum levels (& gt 12 nmol / l) consistent With ovulation. Participants Were Treated for 18 days, three consecutive During cycles. They Were randomized to 15 or 30 mg / day. The menstrual cycle was Monitored With serial ultrasound and hormone assays in blood. Results Fifty-six volunteers completed the study. In 55% of cycles Treated With 15 mg / day and in 78% of cycles Treated With 30mg / day (p & lt 0.001) we Observed dysfunctional ovulation defined as follicular rupture not Preceded 24-48 h Earlier by an LH peak or Preceded by a blunted LH peak (& lt 21 IU / l) or not followed by an elevated serum level P4 & gt 12 nmol / l. Ovulation was Observed in 44.6% and 21.7% of women in the lower dose group in the higher dose group and, respectively. There Were no Differences Between the two deuces in other parameters Measured. There Were no serious adverse events and adverse events Were not different doses or Between Between Control and Treated cycles. Conclusions administration of meloxicam, Although menstrual cycle days on 5- 22 Resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of ovulation, more than 20% of the normal subjects ADH With the highest dose ovulation. Implications Previous studies Have Shown That can delay oral meloxicam follicle rupture. This study Investigated daily oral meloxicam as a non-hormonal contraceptive. Since ovulation OCCURS in over 20% of cycles even with a high dose of 30 mg daily, it is not likely That would be the approach to highly effective contraceptive strategy. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.;CONTRACEPTION;2014;Artículo;Obstetrics & gynecology;0;cycl;ovul;dose;meloxicam;menstrual;;0;0;0;13;6;12;3;15;30
495;481;Expression of Multidrug Resistance Proteins in Prostate Cancer Is Related With Cell Sensitivity to Chemotherapeutic Drugs;BACKGROUND. Multidrug resistance (MDR) proteins Have Been Associated With the lack of chemotherapy response. Expression of These proteins Has Been Described in the prostate, but there is no information About Their role in the chemotherapy response of prostate cancer (PC). We Studied the gene and protein expression of MDR proteins in primary cell cultures from PC PC cell lines and tumors, chemotherapy and Their Relationship With Their effects on cell survival. METHODS. Primary cell cultures from samples from PC Were Obtained provided by our Institutional Hospital. Cell lines LNCaP, PC3, DU145 and Examined Were Present. Were Cells Treated With During 72 hr Several chemotherapeutic drugs. Protein and mRNA expressions of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), MRP1 and LRP, before and after drug treatment, Were EVALUATED by RT-PCR and Western blot analyzes. The effect on cell survival was EVALUATED by proliferation assays (MTT), apoptosis and cell cycle and by flow cytometry. RESULTS. Primary PC cultures exhibited higher expression and MDR lower drug protein sensitivity than cell lines, in Which P-Gp was not detected. Docetaxel and mitoxantrone displayed the highest apoptotic effect. Increased exposure to chemotherapeutic drugs apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and MDR expression. Long-term treatment doxorubicin With diminished apoptosis elicited by all drugs Examined In This study, suggesting a cross-resistance phenomenon. CONCLUSIONS. Low chemotherapy response Observed in PC primary cultures Could Be Explained, in part, by the high levels of MDR proteins (intrinsic MDR phenotype), and also, by Their over-expression induced after long-term exposure to drugs (acquired MDR phenotype), Which treatment Increase resistance. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.;PROSTATE;2009;Artículo;Obstetrics & gynecology;0;mdr;protein;drug;chemotherapi;cultur;protein;107;5;0.0237355811889973;1;5;5;2;16;27

499;911;Pregnancy outcome and fibrinolytic, endothelial and coagulation markers in women undergoing uterine artery Doppler screening at 23 weeks;Background: Pre-eclampsia (PET) and / or fetal growth restriction (FGR) REMAIN a major cause of maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity. In pregnancy, fibrinolysis is controlled by the maternal endothelium and placenta, Both of Which are core to the pathogenesis of PET / FGR. Clinically, uterine artery Doppler screening at 23 weeks is used to predict PET / FGR. An abnormal uterine artery Doppler finding is defined as early bilateral uterine artery diastolic notching (BN) in the waveform. However, About 50% of mothers do not Develop BN With PET / FGR. Objectives: We Investigated fibrinolytic uterine artery Doppler changes and findings in the second trimester, and related them to pregnancy outcome particularly in Assessing Whether fibrinolytic markers Between Normal and Could discriminate abnormal outcome in mothers With BN. Patients / methods: Plasma levels of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 (PAI-2), plasmin antiplasmin-a2 (PAP), D- dimers and markers of endothelial dysfunction Doppler ultrasound With Were Measured at 23 weeks. Results: Those With Decreased ADH BN PAP and D-dimer levels, and raised PAI-1 and thrombomodulin levels. Mothers With BN and PET / ADH FGR Significantly Increased t-PA levels and reduced PAI-2 levels. Conclusions: BN at 23 weeks of gestation is associated With Increased PAI-1 levels. Within the BN group, mothers WHO developed PET / FGR t-PA HAD Increased Decreased levels and PAI-2 levels, there was no net, Although change in fibrinolysis as Measured by D-dimer levels.

500;1037;Bioinformatic detection of E47, E2F1 and SREBP1 transcription factors as potential regulators of genes associated to acquisition of endometrial receptivity;Background: The endometrium is a dynamic tissue changes are driven by Whose the ovarian steroidal hormones. Its main function is to Provide an adequate substrate for embryo implantation. Using microarray technology, Have Several reports provided the gene expression patterns of human endometrial tissue During the window of implantation. However it is required biological connections be made That These genomic datasets across to take full advantage of them. The objective of This work was to perform a research synthesis of available gene expression profiles related to acquisition of endometrial receptivity for embryo implantation, in order to gain insights into molecular basis and ITS regulation.Methods: Were Gene expression datasets intersected to determine a consensus endometrial receptivity transcript list (CERTL). For This cluster of genes we determined to Their functional annotations using available web-based databases. In Addition, promoter sequences Were Analyzed to Identify putative transcription factor binding sites using bioinformatics tools and determined to over-represented features.Results: We found 40 up- and 21 down-regulated transcripts in the CERTL. Those Were more consistently Increased C4BPA, SPP1, APOD, CD55, CFD, CLDN4, DKK1, ID4, IL15 and MAP3K5 Whereas the more consistently Were Decreased OLFM1, CCNB1, CRABP2, EDN3, FGFR1, MSX1 and MSX2. Functional annotation of CERTL Showed it was Enriched With the transcripts related to immune response, complement activation and cell cycle regulation. Promoter sequence analysis of genes revealed binding sites for DNA That E47, E2F1 transcription factors and SREBP1 Were The most consistently over-represented and in Both up- and down-regulated genes During the window of implantation.Conclusions: Our research synthesis allowed organizing and mining high data throughput to explore endometrial receptivity and focus future research on specific genes Efforts and pathways.

502;1719;Role of the transcriptional factors FOXO1 and PPARG on gene expression of SLC2A4 in endometrial tissue from women with polycystic ovary syndrome;Fifty to seventy percent of polycystic ovary syndrome Patients With (PCOS) present hyperinsulinemia. On the other hand, forkhead box reports Indicate That class O 1 (FOXO1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-g (PPARG) are Involved in the insulin signaling pathway, regulating the gene expression of SLC2A4 (GLUT4). The negative effect of FOXO1 over PPARG transcription Disappears When FOXO1 is phosphorylated (p-FOXO1) and excluded from the nucleus, can suppress Whereas PPARG gene expression of SLC2A4. Scarce knowledge is available in endometrium of Women with PCOS and hyperinsulinemia (PCOSE h-Ins) about the role of These factors. We Aimed to Evaluate Whether the endocrine and metabolic status of PCOS modify the levels of gene and protein expression of FOXO1, PPARG, and SLC2A4 in the Endometrial from hyperinsulinemic PCOS women Compared With controls. In endometria from Control (EC, n = 7) or PCOSE h-Ins (n <U+200B><U+200B>= 7), we determined to the subcellular location and protein levels of p-FOXO1Ser319 and FOXO1 / foxo4 by immunohistochemistry and western blot respectively gene and / or protein levels of PPARG and SLC2A4 Were EVALUATED by RT-PCR and / or Western blot. Cytoplasm location for FOXO1 and p-FOXO1Ser319 was immunodetected in Both groups of the endometrium showing Significantly higher staining in PCOSE h-Ins For These proteins (P <0.05). In PCOSE h-Ins, gene and protein levels of PPARG Were Significantly higher than in EC SLC2A4 mRNA was Whereas Decreased (P <0.05). In conclusion, the derepression of transcription PPARG by the high levels of p-FOXO1Ser319 partially account for the Could lower levels of SLC2A4 found in PCOSE h-Ins, suggesting an alteration of the endometrial function In These patients. © 2 Society for Reproduction and Fertility.;REPRODUCTION;2010;Artículo;Obstetrics & gynecology;0;foxo;pparg;slca;gene;pcose;gene;102;6;0.0226264418811003;10;6;1;8;16;30

505;1947;Fundamental discrepancies in abortion estimates and abortion-related mortality: A reevaluation of recent studies in Mexico with special reference to the International Classification of Diseases;In Countries Where abortion is legally restricted induced, as in MOST of Latin America, evaluation of statistics related to induced abortions and abortion-related mortality is challenging. The present article reexamine recent reports estimating the number of induced abortions and abortion-related mortality in Mexico, with special reference to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). We found significant overestimations of abortion figures in the Federal District of Mexico (up to 10-fold) Where elective abortion have legal Been since 2007. Significant overestimation of maternal mortality and abortion-related During the last 20 years in the Mexican Entire country ( up to 35%) was Also found. Such overestimations are most likely to due to the use of in-hospital incomplete records as well as feedback surveys Regarding Subjective induced abortion figures, and due to the consideration of causes of death are unrelated to That induced abortion, Including Flawed denominators of live births. Contrary to previous publications, we found progress in maternal health Important, Reflected by the decrease in maternal mortality overall (30.6%) from 1990 to 2. The use of specific ICD codes revealed That the mortality ratio Associated With Decreased 22.9% induced abortion Between 2002 and 2008 (from 1.48 to 1.14 per 100,000 live births deaths). Currently, approximately 98% of maternal deaths in Mexico are related to causes other than induced abortion, as Such hemorrhage, hypertension and eclampsia, indirect causes, and other pathological conditions. THEREFORE, null or only marginal effects would be expected from changes in the legal status of abortion on overall maternal mortality rates. Rather, maternal health in Mexico would benefit from Greatly increase increasing access to emergency care and specialized obstetric.

507;2078;Lipid Rafts and Cytoskeletal Proteins in Placental Microvilli Membranes from Preeclamptic and IUGR Pregnancies;Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and preeclampsia (PE) are leading causes of perinatal and maternal mortality and morbidity. Previously we reported almost the expression of lipid rafts in microvillous classical membrane (MVM) and light microvillous membrane (LMVM), two subdomains in apical membrane from the syncytiotrophoblast human placental (hSTB), Which Constitute the epithelium responsible for maternal-fetal transport. Here the aim was to study the raft and cytoskeletal proteins from PE and IUGR. Microdomains from MVM and LMVM Were tested With raft markers (placental alkaline phosphatase, lipid ganglioside, and annexin 2) and to nonraft marker (hTf-R). No changes Were detected in whole With Those markers purified standard apical membranes in, PE, and IUGR pregnancies however, Their patterns of distribution in lipid rafts Were different in PE and IUGR. Their segregation modified cholesterol depletion, confirming Their presence in lipid rafts, UNLIKE, Although normal placenta, there is In These pathologies only one type of microdomain. Additionally, the cytoskeleton proteins actin, ezrin, and cytokeratin-7 Showed clear Differences Between Normal and pathological membranes. Cytokeratin-7 expression to 50% in Decreased PE, and the distribution Between LMVM and MVM (~43 and 57%, respectively) in Both PE and changed IUGR, in contrast With the asymmetrical enrichment Obtained in Normal LMVM (~62%).

508;2208;Does childbirth play a role in the etiology of rectocele?;Introduction and hypothesis: Rectoceles Among parous women are common and to be Believed They are due to disruption or distention of the rectovaginal septum as a result of childbirth. However, the etiology of rectocele is likely to be more complex since posterior compartment prolapse does Occur in nulliparous women. This study was designed to determine the role of an etiological factor childbearing as in true radiological rectocele.Methods: This was a secondary analysis of the data from 657 primiparous women Recruited as part of a Previously Reported study and another ongoing prospective study. Were women for antenatal and postnatal invited Appointments Comprising an interview, clinical examination and ultrasonography translabial. The presence and depth of any rectocele Were Determined on maximum Valsalva maneuver, as was the rectal ampulla of descent. Potential demographic and obstetric factors as predictors of development rectocele EVALUATED Were Either using multiple regression analysis or logistic regression as appropriate.Results: A true rectocele was Identified in 4% of women and in 16% antenatally after childbirth (P <0.001). Mean rectocele depth was 13.5 mm (10 - 23.2 mm). The mean antepartum position of the rectal ampulla on Valsalva maneuver was 4.39 mm above and it was 1.64 mm below the symphysis pubis postpartum (P <0.0001). De novo appearance of true rectocele was Significantly associated with a history of previous <20 weeks pregnancy and fetal birth weight. Body mass index and length of the second stage Were Associated With rectocele depth increase.Conclusions: Seems to play a Childbirth distinct role in the pathogenesis of rectocele. Both maternal and fetal factors seem to contribute. © 2015 The International Association Urogynecological;INTERNATIONAL UROGYNECOLOGY JOURNAL;2015;Artículo;Obstetrics & gynecology;0;rectocel;women;childbirth;depth;factor;women;64;10;0.0141969831410825;8;8;12;3;30;21
509;2746;Evaluation of ovarian function in 35-40-year-old women with polycystic ovary syndrome;Objective To ASSESS gonadotrophin secretion, ovarian steroid production and ovarian reserve in PCOS women During the onset of reproductive decline, in order to characterize ovarian Their function At this age. Study design Patients Forty PCOS and 35 healthy women (35-40 years of age) Were included. Clinical history, anthropometry, transvaginal ultrasound and leuprolide acetate to test (10 mg / kg s.c.) Were performed. Gonadotrophins, steroid hormones, SHBG, inhibin B and AMH Were determined. Results Basal and peak LH levels in a similar Were Both groups. Basal and peak FSH levels higher in the Were Significantly Control group. Androgens, oestradiol peak, ovarian volume, antral follicle count and AMH levels Were Significantly higher in PCOS patients. Conclusion These observations Suggest That During late reproductive age, gonadotrophin secretion in Women with PCOS is different from Clearly That Observed in monitoring women and may differ from Past That PCOS of younger patients. New standard features like LH and FSH lower levels associated with a higher ovarian reserve May give a different profile to reproductive These women. © 2 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

510;2756;Prediction of early and late pre-eclampsia from maternal characteristics, uterine artery Doppler and markers of vasculogenesis during first trimester of pregnancy;Objective To Develop a predictive model for pre-eclampsia using clinical, biochemical and ultrasound markers During the first trimester of pregnancy. Methods This was a nested case-control study Within a screening project preeclampsia That 5367 asymptomatic pregnant women Involved Undergoing transvaginal uterine artery routine (UTA) at 11 + Doppler 0 to 13 + 6 weeks. Following exclusions, There Were 70 pregnant women WHO pre-eclampsia later developed Control and 289 Patients Enrolled During the first trimester serum or plasma Who Had samples taken at Enrollment available for the purposes of esta study. Of these, 17 pregnancies Were With diagnosed early-onset (delivery <34 weeks) preeclampsia and late-onset With 53 (delivery = 34 weeks) pre-eclampsia. The lowest, highest and mean of left and right Uta pulsatility indices (PI) Were Calculated. Blood samples Were stored at -84 ° C for analysis biochemical markers Until of vasculogenesis was performed. The distributions of the lowest Uta-PI and the biochemical markers for maternal Characteristics Were adjusted, Expressed as multiple of the median (MoM), and Compared Between groups. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate- if any Variable was associated With Significantly preeclampsia. Results Pregnancies That later developed preeclampsia associated Were With higher pre-pregnancy body mass index maternal. An Increased lowest UTA-PI was Significantly associated early- and late With Both-onset disease. Placental growth factor (PlGF) MoM was Significantly reduced in women WHO early- or late developed later-onset pre-eclampsia Compared With controls (median (interquartile range), 0.69 (0.33-1.46) and 1.10 (0.39-1.56), respectively, vs 1.19 (0.65-1.84), P <0.05). Different models Were combined generated by logistic regression analysis, and the detection rate with a fixed 10% false-positive rate was 47% and 29% for early- and late-onset pre-eclampsia, respectively. Conclusion Pregnancies That later developed early or late pre-eclampsia Were Characterized by impaired placentation and an anti-angiogenic state During the first trimester of pregnancy. Regression models include maternal Which Characteristics, UTA Doppler and PIGF can apparently predict approximately half of pregnancies will be complicated by That early-onset pre-eclampsia. We believe more research is needed in areas Several to aid in the creation of a better and more population-specific screening test for pre-eclampsia During the first trimester of pregnancy.

530;2925;The effect of overweight and obesity on proliferation and activation of AKT and ERK in human endometria;Objective: To examine overweight and obesity Whether Could lead to endometrial proliferation and activation of Increased AKT and ERK1,2 in cycling premenopausal women. Methods: Endometrial and blood samples Were Obtained from Women with regular endometrial histology, and Allocated into three groups-normal-weight, overweight and obese-ACCORDING TO the subject's body mass index (BMI). Samples from Patients With obese type-I Endometrial cancer (EC) Were included as a control. Cell proliferation was Measured by immunohistochemical detection of phosphorylated histone H3 and Ki67 (p-H3). AKT activation and ERK1,2 was Assessed by Western blot. Circulating steroids, leptin and insulin Were Measured by immunoassays. Results: In endometrial histology samples With regular, epithelial cell proliferation was higher in the overweight and obese groups versus the regular-weight set (P <0.05). Were positively correlated indexes proliferation With the subject's BMI and serum levels of estrogen, leptin and insulin (P <0.05). Increased AKT phosphorylated (pAKT) (1.6-fold) and ERK1,2 (pERK1,2) (8.7-fold) Were Observed in endometria With respect to obese from the normal-weight subjects (P <0.05). Similarly, phosphorylation of AKT Increased (0.7-fold) and ERK1,2 (2.3-fold) was detected in Endometrial from overweight as Compared With the average-weight group (P <0.05). In Women with EC, we found a significant Increase in endometrial proliferation, and in pAKT expression levels and pERK1,2 When Compared to Patients With Normal endometrial histology. Conclusion: These results show Correlation between obesity (and overweight) and endometrial Increased cell proliferation, and activation of AKT and the ERK1,2. These features Could be related with the higher risk to Develop EC type-I in overweight and obese women. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

540;3683;Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) modulation of TIMP1 secretion by human endometrial stromal cells facilitates extravillous trophoblast invasion in vitro;STUDY questionare secreted extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling elements, Relevant to embryo implantation and placentation, modified by hCG in endometrial stromal cells (ESCs)? SUMMARY ANSWERhCG Decreases tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1) secretion in ESCs, thereby Facilitating extravillous trophoblast vitro.WHAT IS KNOWN invasion in embryo implantation and placentation ALREADYSuccessful depend on the Appropriate trophoblast invasion of the endometrial stroma into the maternal. hCG is one of the earliest embryo-derived signals secreted in the endometrium Which Expresses hCG receptors abundantly. However, there is little data Concerning the effects of hCG on endometrial ECM remodeling With respect to embryo implantation.PARTICIPANTS / MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODSThis study was Conducted in an academic research laboratory tertiary-care Within a hospital. Collected samples from 36 women Were Undergoing benign gynecological surgery During the mid-secretory phase. Were ESCs isolated and stimulated With hCG (10 IU / ml) or vehicle. conditioned media (CM) Were analysed to determine changes in the profile of secreted matrix metalloproteinases nine (MMPs) and three tissue-specific inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs) using an ELISA array. Data Were confirmed by gelatine zymography, western blot and ELISA. The HTR8 / SVneo cell line served as a model for trophoblast cells. The invasive potential of trophoblast cells was Assessed using Transwell invasion assays under CM or co-culture conditions With ECS and the role of molecules regulated by using immunoprecipitation was Examined in CM prior to the assessment of invasive potential.MAIN RESULTS AND ROLE OF THE CHANCEMMP- Increased levels 30% 2, TIMP-1 levels Whereas Decreased 20% in CM from ESCs With hCG stimulated (P <0.05). Gelatine zymography confirmed an Increase in MMP-2 activity (P <0.05). ELISA and western blotting confirmed the reduction in Present TIMP-1 upon treatment hCG (P <0.05). Invasion assays revealed a ~50% increase in invading HTR8 / SVneo cells in chambers hCG-stimulated With ESCs Compared With the control (P <0.05). Immunodepletion of TIMP-1 from CM-ESC monitoring the effect of partially resembled hCG-stimulated CM from ESCs in the trophoblast invasion assays.LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTIONThe assays performed in vitro and Were ESCs Were not decidualized, Therefore They Reflected the very early stages of embryo implantation or the advanced stages When decidualization fails.WIDER IMPLICATIONS oF THE FINDINGSOur Data Suggest That hCG induces endometrial stromal remodeling by modulating extracellular secreted MMP-2 and TIMP-1. This regulation Physiologically Relevant May be it Increases Because the invasive potential of trophoblast-derived cells. At present, few data exist Concerning the Implications of hCG and endometrial ECM remodeling in embryo implantation.

541;3710;Teenage pregnancy;Teen pregnancy is a social problem not resolved in some developing and developed country clubs. Adolescent fecundity has Become the exact MOST bio-demographic and health indicator of development. That in developing countries are expected to follow the Sexual Behavior patterns of developed country clubs, without offering the levels of education and services for adolescents, will be the Consequences adolescent fecundity and STI prevalence increase. The Ignorance About sexuality and reproduction Both in parents, teachers and adolescents Increases the early initiation of coital relations and of unwanted pregnancies. Extreme poverty and being the daughter of an are or adolescent mother are risk factors of early pregnancy repeating the model. The application of predictive risk criteria in pregnant adolescents to Facilitate the rational use of Health Services to diminish the maternal and perinatal mortality is Discussed as well as social the factors associated With adolescent pregnancy as socioeconomic levels, structure-types and Characteristics of the family, early leaving school, schooling after delivery, female employment, lack of sexual education, parental and family attitudes in different periods of adolescent pregnancy, adolescent pregnancy and decisions on children, unstable partner relationship and adoption as an option. Social Consequences are Analyzed as: incomplete education, more Numerous families, Difficulties in maternal role, abandonment by the partner, fewer possibilities of Having a stable, qualified and well-paid job, greater difficulty in Improving Their socioeconomic level and less probability social of advancement , lack of protection of the recognition of the child. Finally, based on evidence, some Measures That can reduce adverse Consequences on adolescent mothers, fathers and children are Their Suggested. © 2012 by S. Karger AG, P.O.

542;3812;Spermatozoa from mice deficient in Niemann-Pick disease type C2 (NPC2) protein have defective cholesterol content and reduced in vitro fertilising ability;The cholesterol content of the sperm membrane is regulated in the maturation During Both epididymis and capacitation in the female tract, two Processes required for the spermatozoa to acquire Their fertilising ability. Because Niemann-Pick disease, type C2 (NPC2) protein is one of The most abundant components of the epididymal fluid and contains a functional cholesterol-binding site That can transfer cholesterol Between Membranes, it Has Been Suggested for years That NPC2 Could be Involved in the regulation of cholesterol levels in epididymal spermatozoa During maturation. In the present study, immunohistochemistry and western blot analyzes Demonstrated significant levels of NPC2 in the mouse epididymal epithelium. Epididymal spermatozoa from Obtained NPC2 - / - mice Were morphologically regular and ADH Normal motility parameters, but had a reduced cholesterol content Compared With That of wild-type (WT) spermatozoa, as Determined by biochemical and by Both flow cytometry analyzes. These results Suggest That NPC2 Could be Involved in regulating cholesterol levels in epididymal spermatozoa During maturation. To Understand the relevance of epididymal sperm NPC2 for function, the ability of spermatozoa to undergo influenced by events epididymal maturation, capacitation and fertilization Such as, Were Compared Between WT and NPC2 - / - mice. Capacitated NPC2 - / - spermatozoa exhibited defective tyrosine phosphorylation patterns and a reduced ability to fertilize cumulus-oocyte complexes Compared With WT spermatozoa, supporting the relevance of mouse epididymal NPC2 for male fertility. © CSIRO 2014.;REPRODUCTION FERTILITY AND DEVELOPMENT;2014;Artículo;Obstetrics & gynecology;0;npc;epididym;spermatozoa;cholesterol;matur;;0;0;0;12;6;12;9;11;4
543;3921;Human corpus luteum physiology and the luteal-phase dysfunction associated with ovarian stimulation;The human corpus luteum is a temporary endocrine gland That Develops after ovulation from the ruptured follicle During the luteal phase. It is an Important contributor of steroid hormones, progesterone Particularly, and is critical for the maintenance of early pregnancy. Luteal-phase dysfunction can result in premature regression of the gland, with a subsequent shift to an infertile cycle. Understanding the mechanism of corpus luteum steroidogenesis During growth and regression is crucial for Evaluating the Normal physiology and pathophysiology of reproductive cycles. The rate-limiting step in corpus luteum steroidogenesis is the transport of cholesterol to the site of steroid production. Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein is a key player in esta process and is Positively Correlated With troughout the early Progesterone Concentrations an IDDM-luteal phase. Changes in the endocrine environment Brought on by the gonadotrophins used for ovarian stimulation are thought to underlie the corpus luteum dysfunction Associated With IVF cycles. While ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome is associated human chorionic gonadotrophin With (HCG), Studies Suggest That exogenous Provides Necessary luteal progesterone support in Patients Undergoing IVF. The current trend towards single use of protocols and the single-embryo transfers further stimulation Provide opportunity to revisit HCG administration as luteal support. © 2009 Published by Reproductive Healthcare Ltd.;REPRODUCTIVE BIOMEDICINE ONLINE;2009;Artículo;Obstetrics & gynecology;0;luteal;corpus;luteum;cycl;phase;;0;0;0;12;6;12;6;15;30

The circa-vacation-study expectancy rhythm of incidence and age at menarche;The hypothesis That the vacation-study-expectancy scholar MOST of the regime produces monthly rhythm of the age at menarche (AAM) was tested. Studies on monthly menarche incidence (MI) Refuted climatic factors as a main factor in esta rhythm, and Indicated That the main factor of esta rhythm is the succession of expectancies of study (Stu-months) or vacation (Vac-months) months Within a year. THUS the hypothesis of seasonal circa-annual rhythm Should be modified to the circa- [vacation (holiday)] - [study (non-party)] - expectancies rhythm for the age at menarche MI and annual rhythms. Several country clubs in months Vac-MI HAD higher than Stu-months.

545;4020;VEGF in the muscular layer of placental blood vessels: Immuno-expression in preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restrictrion and its association with the antioxidant status;The pathophysiology of preeclampsia (PE), to 5% disorder occurring in all of pregnancies, remains unknown Largely, but early placental hypoxia and oxidative stress are Known to be Involved in the mechanism of the syndrome. Maternal plasma and placental tissue samples from Were Collected PE, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), and normotensive pregnant patients. The immunohistochemical expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), malondialdehyde (MDA) production and the activity of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase GSH-Px) Were Determined in the placental tissue. F2-isoprostane concentration and the ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) in maternal plasma Were Determined. We found That the PE and IUGR groups Showed expression of VEGF to higher in the muscle layer of fetal chorionic vessels. In Addition, Increased plasma F2 isoprostane levels and a significant reduction of FRAP in the plasma of women PE, as well as to lower activity of SOD in PE placentas and a higher activity of GSH-Px in IUGR placentas were found. Additionally, lower PlGF and sFlt-1 levels higher Were Observed in the maternal plasma of PE and IUGR than control. We Concluded That in a hypoxic environment, the placenta Expresses VEGF in the muscular layer of fetal vessels. The development of PE Could be related to the expression of VEGF Increased, with SOD activity Decreased placental and a decrease of Both plasma F2-isoprostane levels and FRAP. In turn, the development of IUGR Could be related to the association of plasma FRAP Decreased Increased levels and placental GSH-Px activity. © 2 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.;Cardiovascular And Hematological Agents In Facultad De Medicinal Chemistry;2010;Artículo;Obstetrics & gynecology;0;plasma;activ;iugr;placent;frap;activ;155;1;0.0343833185448092;13;5;13;3;17;32
546;4042;Effects of antioxidant vitamins on newborn and placental traits in gestations at high altitude: comparative study in high and low altitude native sheep;The present study EVALUATED That the hypothesis on the effects of hypoxia at high altitude sheep pregnancies (HA) are mediated by oxidative stress and antioxidant vitamins That May Prevent These effects. Both HA native and newcomer Ewes maintained at an altitude Were of 3589m During mating and pregnancy. Control low altitude (LA) native Ewe Were maintained at sea level. Half of each group received daily oral supplements of vitamins C (500mg) and E (350IU) During mating and gestation. Near term, maternal plasma vitamin levels and oxidative stress biomarkers Were Measured. At delivery, lambs Were Weighed and Measured, and placentas Were macroscopic and microscopic recovered for evaluation. Vitamin Concentrations in Supplemented ewes two- or threefold Were greater than in non-Supplemented ewes. Plasma carbonyls and malondialdehyde in non-Supplemented ewes Were consistent with a state of oxidative stress, Which was preventer by vitamin supplementation. Increased vitamin supplementation lamb birthweight and cotyledon number in Both HA native and newcomer Ewes, placental weight and cotyledon, Although Were diminished surface. Placentas from vitamin-Supplemented HA Ewes Were similar to Those from ewes at either level, making placental These traits (weight, diameter and number of cotyledons) similar to Those from ewes at either level. Vitamin supplementation no effect on HAD THE pregnancies. In conclusion, vitamins C and supplementation With E During Pregnancy at HA oxidative stress Prevents, pregnancy outcomes Improving. © 2011 CSIRO.;REPRODUCTION FERTILITY AND DEVELOPMENT;2011;Artículo;Obstetrics & gynecology;0;ewe;supplement;vitamin;pregnanc;oxid;;0;0;0;2;6;2;10;17;32
415;180;Large contribution of human papillomavirus in vaginal neoplastic lesions: A worldwide study in 597 samples;Aim: This work describe the human papillomavirus (HPV) and the HPV prevalence type distribution in a large series of vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN) grades 03/02 and vaginal cancer worldwide. Methods: We analysed VAIN 189 2/3 and 408 invasive vaginal cancer cases from 31 Collected from 1986 to 2011. Countries After histopathological evaluation of formalin-fixed paraffin sectioned-embedded samples, HPV DNA detection and typing was performed using the SPF-10 / DNA enzyme immunoassay (DEIA) / LiPA25 system (version 1). A subset of 146 vaginal cancers was tested for p16INK4a expression, a surrogate marker for HPV cellular transformation. Estimated prevalence ratios using multivariate Poisson Were With robust variance regression. Results: HPV DNA was detected in 74% (95% confidence interval (CI) 70-78%) of invasive cancers and in 96% (95% CI: 92-98%) of VAIN 2/3. Among cancers, the highest detection rates Were Observed in warty-basaloid subtype of squamous cell carcinomas, and in younger ages. Concerning the type-specific distribution, the HPV16 was detected in type Most Frequently precancerous and cancerous lesions Both (59%). p16INK4a overexpression was found in 87% of HPV DNA positive vaginal cancer Cases. Conclusions: HPV was Identified in a large proportion of invasive vaginal cancers and in almost all VAIN 2/3. HPV16 was The most common type detected.

416;183;Role of Cytokine Gene Polymorphisms in Gastric Cancer Risk in Chile;Aim: To ASSESS the role of pro- and anti-inflammatory polymorphisms in gastric cancer susceptibility. Patients and Methods: We genotyped 12 polymorphisms in genes eight cytokine (Interleukin-1ß-IL1B-, IL8, 17A, 17F, IL32, tumor necrosis factor-a-TNF, IL1RN, IL10) in a case-control study of 147 Patients With gastric cancer and 172 controls. Results: Single polymorphism analysis revealed an association Between the IL10 -592C> A single nucleotide polymorphism and cases With moderately- or well-Differentiated tumors [AA vs. GG, odds ratio (OR) = 3.01 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.08-8.50]. We further Analyzed gene-gene interactions using a combined network attribute multifactor dimensionality reduction Implemented in software. The analysis revealed an interaction Between IL8 -251A> T and IL32 SNPs rs28372698 With moderately- Among cases or well-Differentiated tumors. Homozygosity for IL8 Both -251T and IL32 T alleles Increases the odds for developing gastric cancer up to 2.63-fold (OR = 2.63 95% CI = 1.15-6.03).

418;373;Protein Kinase CK2 Promotes Cancer Cell Viability Via Up-Regulation of Cyclooxygenase-2 Expression and Enhanced Prostaglandin E2 Production;Augmented expression of protein kinase CK2 is associated With hyperproliferation and resistance to apoptosis in cancer cells. Effects of CK2 are at Least partially linked to signaling via the Wnt / ß-catenin pathway, Which is Dramatically enhanced in colon cancer. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), Wnt / ß-catenin target gene, you has-been associated With cancer progression and metastasis enhanced. However, the Possibility That a connection exist Between May CK2 and COX-2 has not Been Previously explored. Here we Investigated changes in COX-2 expression and activity upon CK2 modulation and EVALUATED how These changes AFFECTED cell viability. COX-2 expression and cell viability upon Decreased inhibition of COX-selective 2 with SC-791 or CK2 with 2-dimethylamino-4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzimidazole (TAED), Both in human colon (HT29- ATCC, HT29-US, DLD-1) and breast (ZR-75) cancer cells, as well as in human embryonic kidney (HEK-293T) cells. On the other hand, ectopic expression CK2a Promoted up-regulation of COX-2 by activating the Wnt / ß-catenin pathway in HEK-293T cells. Noteworthy, over-expression of Either CK2a, ß-catenin or COX-2, as well as supplementation of the medium With prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), all Were individually sufficient to Overcome limitations in cell viability triggered by CK2 inhibition Either upon Addition of DMAT or over-expression of a dominant negative variant CK2a. Altogether, These findings Provide new insight to the role of CK2 in cancer by up-regulating COX-2 expression and PGE2 production thereby. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.;JOURNAL OF CELLULAR BIOCHEMISTRY;2011;Artículo;Oncology;0;cox;cancer;catenin;ckÎ;upon;cancer;120;4;0.0266193433895297;1;5;7;8;16;4
419;402;Early Gallbladder Cancer: Is Further Treatment Necessary?;Background and Objectives: The goal of esta study was to Evaluate Patients With a series of early gallbladder cancer, focusing on the selection of treatment and the role of Rokitansky Aschoff sinus infiltration. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of a prospective series of 371 Patients With gallbladder cancer. Specimens Were reviewed by an independent pathologist to confirm the diagnosis and depth of infiltration and to Evaluate the presence of Rokitansky Aschoff sinus Involvement. Results: Forty-nine and 45 Patients With muscular (pT1b) and mucosal (pT1a) infiltration gallbladder cancer tumors Were Studied respectively. Simple cholecystectomy was the treatment in all Patients, with the exception of 11 WHO Patients underwent further surgery. Rokitansky Aschoff sinus invasion was seen in seven Patients With mucosa (pT1a) and three With muscle (pT1b) compromise. The 5-year survival rates of Patients With muscular (pT1b) and mucosal (pT1a) 87.6% Were infiltration and 86.4%, respectively. Patients With Rokitansky Aschoff had a lower survival Involvement rate than Those With No Involvement in Both categories. Conclusions: Early gallbladder cancer is associated with a positive prognosis and cholecystectomy Should be the standard treatment. DESPITE some Patients Having a worse prognosis, there are no data to support more aggressive treatment. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.;JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY;2009;Artículo;Oncology;0;aschoff;cancer;gallbladd;infiltr;rokitanski;cancer;120;4;0.0266193433895297;1;8;7;7;22;23
420;432;Chemotherapy Sensitivity Recovery of Prostate Cancer Cells by Functional Inhibition and Knock Down of Multidrug Resistance Proteins;BACKGROUND In Several cancer types, expression of multidrug resistance (MDR) proteins Has Been Associated With lack of chemotherapy response. In advanced prostate cancer (PCa) the use of chemotherapy is mainly due to palliative ITS high resistance. Previously, we MDR phenotype Described in PCa That Could be related with high basal expression and drug-induced MDR proteins of P-Glycoprotein (P-gp), MRP1, and LRP. Using cell cultures METHODS primary PCa from Patients, we EVALUATED the effect of function and expression of P-gp inhibition, MRP1, and LRP, on cell survival after exposure chemotherapy. Were Cells Treated With specific MDR protein substrates (docetaxel and mitoxantrone for P-Gp, methotrexate for MRP1 and cisplatin for LRP) and pharmacological inhibitors (cyclosporine A, genistein and 3-aminobenzamide), and cell survival was EVALUATED trough 3- (4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) -2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and cell cycle analysis. MRP1 activity was EVALUATED by FACS using the specific inhibitor MK571. Cells Were transfected With MDR proteins siRNAs and Treated With The Corresponding substrates. RESULTS PCa cell resistance to MDR protein was partially reversed substrates, decreasing cell survival in around 20%, by treating cell cultures With specific primary pharmacological inhibitors. With PCa cells transfected siRNAs against MDR proteins Decreased cell survival When Treated With The Corresponding drugs. Docetaxel was The most effective chemotherapeutic drug to induce cell death and decrease survival. CONCLUSION Low chemotherapy response in PCa Could Be Explained, in part, by over-expression of functional MDR proteins. Expression and function of These proteins Should be EVALUATED to Enhance efficacy of docetaxel-based therapies of Patients With hormone-resistant PCa.

421;436;Menarche, menopause, and breast cancer risk: individual participant meta-analysis, including 118 964 women with breast cancer from 117 epidemiological studies;Background menarche and menopause mark the onset and cessation, respectively, of ovarian activity associated With reproduction, and Affect breast cancer risk. Our aim was to ASSESS the strengths of Their effects and determine Whether They depend on Characteristics of the Tumors or the AFFECTED women. Methods Individual data from epidemiological studies 117, 118 964 Including Women with invasive breast cancer and without the disease 306,091, none of Whom HAD used menopausal hormone therapy, Were included in the analyzes. We adjusted relative Calculated Risks (RRs) With menarche and menopause associated for breast cancer overall, and by tumor histology and estrogen receptor expression by. Findings Breast cancer risk factor of Increased by at 1.050 (95% CI 1044-1057 p <0.0001) for every year at menarche younger, and by a smaller amount Independently (1029, 1025-1032 p <0.0001), for every year older at menopause. Premenopausal women had a greater risk of breast cancer than women of an identical postmenopausal age (age 45-54 years at RR 1.43, 1.33-1.52, p <0.001). All three of These associations Were attenuated by Increasing adiposity Among postmenopausal women, but did not vary materially by women's year of birth, ethnic origin, childbearing history, smoking, alcohol, consumption, or hormonal contraceptive use. All three associations for lobular Were stronger than for ductal Tumors (p <0.006 for each comparison). The effect of menopause in women of an age identical and trends by age at menopause estrogen receptor Were stronger for disease-positive for estrogen receptor than-negative disease (p <0.01 for comparisons Both).

422;444;Ovarian cancer and smoking: individual participant meta-analysis including 28 114 women with ovarian cancer from 51 epidemiological studies;Background Smoking has-been linked to mucinous ovarian cancer, but eff ects on other ITS ovarian cancer subtypes and on overall ovarian cancer risk are unclear, and the fi ndings from studies With Relevant data MOST are unpublished. To ASSESS These associations, we review the published and unpublished evidence. Methods Eligible epidemiological studies identifi ed Were by electronic searches, review articles, and discussions With colleagues. Individual participant data for 28 114 94 942 Women with and without ovarian cancer from 51 epidemiological studies analysed Were centrally, yielding adjusted relative Risks (RRs) of ovarian cancer in smokers Compared With never smokers. Findings After exclusion of studies With hospital controls, in Which Have aff ected smoking recruitment Could, overall ovarian cancer incidence was only slightly Increased in current smokers Compared With Women Who Had never smoked (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01-1.11, p = 0.01 ). Of 17,641 epithelial cancers specifi ed With histology, 2314 (13%) Were mucinous, 2360 (13%) endometrioid, 969 (5%) clear-cell, and 9086 (52%) serous. Smoking-related Risks Substantially varied across These subtypes (pheterogeneity & lt 0.0001). For mucinous cancers, incidence was Increased in current versus never smokers (1.79, 95% CI 1.60-2.00, p & lt 0.0001), but was mainly in the Increase borderline malignant rather than in fully malignant Tumors (2.25, 95% CI 1.91-2.65 vs 1.49, 1.28-1.73 pheterogeneity = 0.01, almost half the mucinous borderline malignant Tumors Were only). Both endometrioid (0.81, 95% CI 0.72-0.92, p = 0.001) and clear-cell ovarian cancer Risks (0.80, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.97, p = 0.03) Were reduced in current smokers, and there was no signifi cant association for serous ovarian cancers (0.99, 95% CI 0.93-1.06, p = 0.8). These associations did not vary signifi cantly by 13 Sociodemographic and Personal Characteristics of women Including Their body-mass index, parity, and use of alcohol, oral contraceptives, and menopausal hormone therapy. Interpretation The excess of mucinous ovarian cancers in smokers, Which is mainly of Tumors of borderline malignancy, is roughly counterbalanced by the defi cit of endometrioid and clear-cell ovarian cancers.

423;475;Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone Analogs Induce Apoptosis by Extrinsic Pathway Involving p53 Phosphorylation in Primary Cell Cultures of Human Prostatic Adenocarcinomas;BACKGROUND. Gonadotropin-releasing-hormone (GnRH) analogs are used to block Widely-pituitary-gonadal hypothalamic axis and inhibit androgen blood levels in Patients With prostate cancer (PCa). In Addition, GnRH analogs induces proliferation arrest and apoptosis through GnRH receptors on the membrane of Expressed PCa cells. Possible Mechanisms Involved in molecular GnRH-mediated apoptosis on cancer cells Were Studied prostate. METHODS. Primary cultures from PCa and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) (non-malignant control) Were derived from samples provided by our Institutional Hospital. Cell cultures incubated for 24 hr Were With 20 ng / ml of GnRH agonist leuprolide (Lp) or antagonist Cetrorelix (Cx). Apoptosis was EVALUATED by studying the expression of Bax and Bcl-2 and the activation of caspase-9 (intrinsic pathway), caspase-8 (extrinsic pathway), and caspase-3. Also, mRNA level, protein expression and phosphorylation of p53 Were Studied. RESULTS. Cleaved caspase-8 and -3, but not -9, in presence of Lp Increased and Cx in PCa cell cultures. Bax and Bcl-2 mRNA levels after Showed no changes GnRH-analog treatments. Only Showed an Increase Bax protein after treatment Cx in PCa cell cultures. p53 mRNA level was higher in PCa than in BPH cell cultures. Lp and Cx Increased p53 expression and phosphorylation in PCa cell cultures. CONCLUSIONS. Apoptosis induced by GnRH Analogs Seems to be mediated by p53 phosphorylation extrinsic pathway Involving. Phosphorylated-p53 Might Be Associated With the Increase in apoptotic NGF receptor, p75, Previously Reported by our laboratory. These findings Reinforce the concept of clinical use of GnRH Analogs for PCa treatment suggesting intraprostatic That May be more effective. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.;PROSTATE;2009;Artículo;Oncology;0;gnrh;pca;cultur;analog;apoptosi;;0;0;0;5;5;5;8;16;27
424;479;Pharmacokinetics of High-Dose Methotrexate in Infants Treated for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia;Background. Interfant-99 was an international collaborative treatment protocol for infants With acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Procedure. We Collected data on 103 infants at the time of first treatment With Their high-dose methotrexate (MTX HD), 5 g / m2. Children & lt 6 months of age received two-third of the dose based on body Calculated surface area (BSA), children 6-12 months of the fourth Three- Calculated dose, and children & gt 12 months full dose. Results. The median steady-state concentration at the end MTX of the 24-hr infusion was 57.8 mM (range 9.5-313). The mediate systemic clearance was 6.22 L / hr / m2 BSA, and dig a to Increase with age (P = 0.099). Boys ADH higher than girls clearance, 6.77 and 5.28 L / hr / m2 (P = 0.030), and dig a To have lower concen-tration mediate MTX at 24 hr. Eight infants ADH MTX levels below 20 mM, sufficient level Judged to be in B-lineage ALL in children & gt 1 year of age. All infants tolerated the dose well enough to receive a second dose of MTX HD without dose reduction. We found no significant effect on disease-free survival for steady-state concentration MTX, MTX clearance, time to MTX or below 0.2 mM. Conclusions. Our data do not support Provide for a change in the rules for MTX dosing used in Interfant-99. However, in view of the poor treatment results for infants, one Might Consider Increase in the dose for Patients WHO reach plasma levels below the median after first dose MTX. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.;PEDIATRIC BLOOD & CANCER;2009;Artículo;Oncology;0;dose;mtx;infant;children;age;children;177;0;0.0392635314995563;13;8;9;10;14;33
425;575;Hypertension and the Risk of Breast Cancer in Chilean Women: a Case-control Study;Background: Breast cancer is the MOST common cancer in women worldwide. , Although different metabolic factors in breast Have Been Implicated cancer development, the relationship Between hypertension and breast cancer has not Been elucidated. Aim: To Evaluate hypertension as a risk factor for breast cancer in women of low and Chilean middle socio-economic status. Methods: We Conducted an age-matched (1: 1) case-control study in three hospitals in Santiago, Chile. Breast cancer cases (n = 170) Were histopathologically confirmed. Been HAD Controls classified as Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System I (negative) or II (benign findings) in 6 months of recruitment. Blood pressure was using a mercury sphygmomanometer Measured and standardized procedures. We used two cut-off points hypertension: blood pressures of =140 / 90 mmHg and =130 / 85 mmHg. Fasting insulin and glucose levels Were Assessed, and anthropometric, Sociodemographic, and behavioral information Were Collected. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the Entire Were Estimated sample and restricted to postmenopausal women using multivariable conditional logistic regression models. Results: Hypertension (=140 / 90 mmHg) was Significantly higher in cases (37.1%) than controls (17.1%) for the Entire sample and in postmenopausal pairs (44.0% to 23.8% Compared). In crude and adjusted models, hypertensive women had a 4-fold risk of breast cancer Increased (odds ratio adjusted: 4.2 95% confidence interval: 1.8 9.6) Compared to non-hypertensive women in the Entire sample. We found a similar association to in the postmenopausal group (adjusted odds ratio 2.8 95% confidence interval: 1.1 7.4).

426;647;Intensive care in patients with lung cancer: a multinational study;Background: Detailed information About Lung Cancer Patients Requiring admission to intensive care units (ICUs) is mostly restricted to single-center studies. Our aim was to Evaluate the Clinical Characteristics and outcomes of lung cancer Patients ADMITTED to ICUs. Patients and methods: Prospective Multicenter Study in Patients With 449 lung cancer (small cell, n = 55 non-small cell, n = 394) ADMITTED to 22 ICUs in six Countries in Europe and South America Multivariate Cox 2011. During proportional hazards frailty Were models built to Identify Characteristics associated With 30-day and 6-month mortality. Results: Most of the Patients (71%) newly diagnosed cancer ADH. Cancer-related complications occurred in 56% of Patients The most common tumor was airway Involvement (26%). Ventilatory support was required in 53% of patients. Overall hospital, 30-day, and 6-month mortality rates Were 39%, 41%, and 55%, respectively. After adjustment for type of admission and treatment decisions early-limitation, determinants of mortality Were organ dysfunction severity, poor performance status (PS), recurrent / progressive cancer, and cancer-related complications. Mortality rates far lower Were in the patient subset With nonrecurrent / progressive cancer and a good PS, Even Those With sepsis, multiple organ dysfunctions, and need for ventilatory support. Mortality was lower in Present high-volume centers. Poor PS Predicted failure to receive the planned INITIALLY cancer treatment after hospital discharge. Conclusions: ICU admission was associated With survival in lung cancer meaningful Patients with good PS and nonrecurrent / progressive disease. Conversely, mortality rates were very high in Patients not fit for anticancer treatment and poor PS. In This subgroup, palliative care May be the best option. © The Author 2014.

427;706;Association of PALB2 sequence variants with the risk of familial and early-onset breast cancer in a South-American population;Background: Germline mutations in PALB2 Have been identified in approximately 1% of familial breast cancer (BC) in Several Populations. NEVERTHELESS ITS contribution in the South-American population is unknown. The goal of esta study was to determine the prevalence of PALB2 mutations in the Chilean population. Methods: 100 Chilean BRCA1 / 2-Negatives BC familial cases Were included for the PALB2 mutation analysis. We use gel electrophoresis and conformational sensitive direct sequencing. Using a case-Control design, we Studied the Identified variants in 436 cases and 809 controls BC to evaluate- Their possible association with BC risk. Results: No pathogenic mutations Were detected. We Identified three variants, the variant c.1861C> A was not found in Described Previously one of the 436 cases and none of the 809 controls. The bioinformatic analyzes Indicate That probably is not esta pathogenic variant. PALB2 c.1676A> G (rs152451A / G) and c.2993C> T (rs45551636C / T) variants Were Significantly With Increased BC risk associated only in cases with a strong family history of BC (OR = 1.9 [95% CI 1.3- 2.8] p <0.01 and OR = 3.3 [95% CI 1.4-7.3] p <0.01, respectively). The rs152451A / G-rs45551636C / T genotype produces composite Increase of the BC risk in cases with a strong family history of BC (OR = 3.6 [95% CI 1.7-8.0] p = 0.003). The rs152451-G / rs45551636 rs152451-C-G and / rs45551636-T haplotypes associated Were With An Increased risk BC only in cases with a strong family history of BC (OR = 1.6 [95% CI 1.0-2.5] p = 0.05 and OR = 3.7 [95% CI 1.8-7.5] p <0.001, respectively). Conclusion: Our results Suggest That PALB2 c.1676A> G and c.2993C> T play roles in BC risk in women with a strong family history of BC. © Leyton et al.;BMC CANCER;2015;Artículo;Oncology;0;famili;palb;risk;variant;histori;risk;47;19;0.0104259094942325;12;6;19;4;18;9
428;737;Human papillomavirus and Epstein-Barr virus infections in breast cancer from chile;Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) and Epstein Barr virus (EBV) Have Been Found in breast carcinomas (BCs) around the world. In This study, fifty-five BCs from Chile Were Analyzed for HPV and EBV presence. In Addition, HPV-16 viral load / physical status and E6 / E7 expressions Were determined. Results: The amplification of a housekeeping gene Showed That 46/55 samples (84%) ADH amplifiable DNA. HPV-16 was detected in 4/46 BCs (8.7%) and EBV was detected in 3/46 (6.5%) BCs. The analysis of HPV-16 physical status esta Showed That virus was integrated in all of the tumors with a low viral load Relatively (range: 0.14 to 33.8 copies / cell). E6 and E7 transcripts, however, not detected in any Were HPV-16 positive specimens. Using Cox regression model-, we found a statistically significant association Between EBV presence and poor survival (p = 0.). Conclusions: The findings In This study Suggest That it is unlikely That HPV and / or EBV play a direct role in the etiology of BC. © 2011 Aguayo et al licensee BioMed Central Ltd.;INFECTIOUS AGENTS AND CANCER;2011;Artículo;Oncology;0;hpv;ebv;bcs;found;load;;0;0;0;7;8;20;6;20;17
429;809;Human papillomavirus genotype attribution in invasive cervical cancer: a retrospective cross-sectional worldwide study;Background: Knowledge About the distribution of human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes in invasive cervical cancer is crucial to guide the introduction of prophylactic vaccines. We Aimed to Provide novel and comprehensive data About the worldwide genotype distribution in invasive cervical cancer Patients With. Methods: Paraffin-embedded samples of histologically confirmed cases of invasive cervical cancer Were Collected from 38 Countries in Europe, North America, Central South America, Africa, Asia and Oceania. Were Inclusion criteria for pathological confirmation of a primary invasive cervical cancer of epithelial origin in the tissue sample selected for analysis of HPV DNA, and information About the year of diagnosis. HPV detection was done by use of PCR With SPF-10 broad-spectrum primers followed by DNA enzyme immunoassay and genotyping with a reverse hybridisation line probe assay. Sequence analysis was done to characterise HPV-positive samples With unknown HPV types. Data analyzes included algorithms of multiple infections to estimate type-specific relative Contributions. Findings: 22661 paraffin-embedded samples Were Obtained from 14,249 women. 10,575 cases of invasive cervical cancer in the study included Were, and 8977 (85%) of These positive for HPV DNA Were. The most common HPV types Were 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 45, 52, and 58 with a combined contribution of relative worldwide 8196 of 8977 (91%, 95% CI 90-92). HPV types 16 and 18 Were detected in 6357 of 8977 of cases (71%, 70 to 72) of invasive cervical cancer. HPV types 16, 18, and 45 Were detected in 443 of 470 cases (94%, 92 to 96) of cervical adenocarcinomas. Unknown HPV types That Were Identified With sequence analysis Were 26, 30, 61, 67, 69, 82, and 91 in 103 (1%) of 8977 cases of invasive cervical cancer. Women with invasive cervical cancers related to HPV types 16, 18, or 45 presented at a younger age than did mean other HPV types Those With (50 · 0 years [49 · 6-50 · 4] 48 · 2 years [47 · 3-49 · 2] 46 · 8 years [46 · 6-48 · 1], and 55 · 5 years [54 · 9-56 · 1], respectively). Interpretation: To our knowledge, This study is the largest assessment of HPV genotypes to date. HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 45, 52, and 58 Should be Given priority When the cross-protective effects of current vaccines are Assessed, and for formulation of Recommendations for the use of second-generation polyvalent HPV vaccines. Our results Also Suggest that type-specific high-risk HPV-DNA-based screening tests and protocols focus on HPV Should types 16, 18, and 45.

431;879;Ovarian Cancer and Body Size: Individual Participant Meta-Analysis Including 25,157 Women with Ovarian Cancer from 47 Epidemiological Studies;Background: Only About half the studies That Have Collected information on the relevance of women's height and body mass index to Their risk of developing ovarian cancer Have Their published results, and findings are inconsistent. Here, we bring together the worldwide evidence, published and unpublished, and describes These relationships. Methods and Findings: Individual data on 25.157 Women with ovarian cancer and 81.311 women without ovarian cancer from 47 epidemiological studies Were Collected, checked, and analysed Centrally. Adjusted Risks of ovarian cancer relative Were Calculated, by height and by body mass index. Ovarian cancer risk Increased Significantly With height and with body mass index, except in studies using hospital controls. For other study designs, the relative risk of ovarian cancer per 5 cm Increase in height was 1.07 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-1.09 p & lt 0.001) esta relationship did not vary Significantly by women's age, year of birth, education, age at menarche, parity, menopausal status, smoking, alcohol, consumption, Having had a hysterectomy, Having first degree relatives With ovarian or breast cancer, use of contraceptives oral, or use of menopausal hormone therapy. For body mass index, there was significant heterogeneity (p & lt 0.001) in the findings Between ever-users and never-users of menopausal hormone therapy, but not by the other factors listed above 11. The relative risk for ovarian cancer per 5 kg / m2 Increase in body mass index was 1.10 (95% CI, 1.07-1.13 p & lt 0.001) in never-users and 0.95 (95% CI, 0.92 to 0.99 p = 0.02) in ever-users of hormone therapy. Conclusions: Ovarian cancer is associated With height and, Among never-users of hormone therapy, with body mass index. In high-income countries, Both height and body mass index Have Been Increasing in birth cohorts now developing the disease. If all other factors Relevant ADH Remained constant, then a Increases in height and in Original weight would be associated with a 3% increase in ovarian cancer incidence per decade. © 2012 Collaborative Group on Epidemiological Studies of Ovarian Cancer.;PLOS MEDICINE;2012;Artículo;Oncology;0;cancer;ovarian;bodi;height;index;cancer;120;4;0.0266193433895297;1;3;7;3;10;45

433;1025;Haploidentical stem cell transplantation for children with high-risk leukemia;Background: The Chilean population is ethnically diverse, and more than 50% of children for hematopoietic stem Referred cell transplantation (HSCT) lack a suitable donor. Procedure: To expand the donor pool, we Assessed the feasibility, tolerance, and efficacy of using a haploidentical (HI) donor and a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen for high-risk pediatric leukemia. This study was Facilitated by technology transfer from St. Jude Children's Research Hospital PRECEDING over the two years. Results: Between March 2006 and April 2009 10 Patients (median age, 9.8 years) received T cell-depleted grafts at Calvo Mackenna Hospital in Santiago. Median CD34 + cell doses Were: 7.45 × 106 / kg (range, 4.00-20.20 x 106 / kg) CD3 + 0.88 × 105 / kg (0.11-1.35 × 105 / kg) and CD56 +: 71.30 × 106 / kg (31.50-131.80 × 106 / kg). Nine Patients experienced complete engraftment Six of the nine REMAIN alive and clinically well 13-50 months post-HSCT. Three Patients died after bone marrow relapse, while only one died of transplant-related causes. Virus reactivation was the main post-transplant complication: 10.05 ADH PCR positive CMV CMV disease but none ADH. One patient developed acute GvHD & gt grade II and only chronic GvHD HAD one. Conclusions: HI-HSCT is feasible in our setting, offers a rational treatment option, and expands the donor pool for Children with Significantly high-risk leukemia in a developing country.

434;1062;Tumor and reproductive traits are linked by RNA metabolism genes in the mouse ovary: a transcriptome-phenotype association analysis;Background: The link Between reproductive life history and incidence of ovarian tumors is well known. Periods of reduced ovulations May CONFER protection against ovarian cancer. Using phenotypic data available for mouse, a possible association Between the ovarian transcriptome, reproductive records and ovarian tumor spontaneous rates was Investigated in four inbred mouse strains. NIA15k-DNA microarrays Were employed to obtener expression profiles of BalbC, C57BL6, FVB and SWR adult ovaries.Results: Linear regression analysis with multiple-control test (adjusted p = 0.05) Resulted in ovarian tumor frequency (OTF) and number of litters ( NL) as the top-Correlated Among five phenotypes tested. , Moreover, Nearly one-hundred genes Were coincident Between These two traits and Were decomposed in 76 OTF (-) NL (+) and 20 OTF (+) NL (-) genes, Where the plus / minus signs Indicate the direction of correlation. Were Enriched functional categories RNA-binding / mRNA-protein folding and processing in the OTF (-) NL (+) and the OTF (+) NL (-) subsets, respectively. In contrast, no associations Were detected Between OTF and litter size (LS), the Latter to measure events of ovulation in a single estrous cycle.Conclusion: Literature text-mining pointed to post-transcriptional Control of ovarian oocyte maturation Including procesos, folliculogenesis and angiogenesis as possible causal relationships of Observed tumor and reproductive phenotypes. We speculate That repetitive cycling Instead of repetitive ovulations Represent the current link ovarian tumorigenesis and reproductive Between records. © 2 Urzúa et al licensee BioMed Central Ltd.;BMC GENOMICS;2010;Artículo;Oncology;0;ovarian;otf;reproduct;tumor;ovul;tumor;59;12;0.0130878438331854;12;6;7;4;25;3
435;1092;Outcomes of adrenal-sparing surgery or total adrenalectomy in phaeochromocytoma associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2: an international retrospective population-based study;Background: The prevention of medullary thyroid cancer in Patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 syndrome have Demonstrated the ability of molecular diagnosis and prophylactic surgery to Improve patient outcomes. However, the other major endocrine neoplasia associated with multiple neoplasia type 2 phaeochromocytoma, is not as well Characterized in terms of occurrence and treatment outcomes. In This study, we characterise Systematically Aimed to the outcomes of management of phaeochromocytoma associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2. Methods: This observational retrospective multinational study population-based data compiled on Patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 from 30 academic medical centers across Europe , the Americas, and Asia. Patients Were included if They Were carriers of germline mutations of the RET pathogenic gene, or first-degree relatives Were With histologically proven phaeochromocytoma and medullary thyroid cancer. We recogida clinical information about prep patients' RET genotype, type of treatment for phaeochromocytoma (ie, unilateral operations bilateral or as adrenalectomy or adrenal-sparing surgery, and as open or endoscopic operations), and postoperative outcomes (adrenal function, malignancy, and death) . The type of surgery was DECIDED by each investigator and the timing of surgery was driven patient. The primary aim of our analysis was to compare disease-free survival after adrenal-sparing surgery Either or adrenalectomy. Findings: 1210 with multiple endocrine neoplasia Patients type 2 Were included in our database, 563 of Whom HAD phaeochromocytoma. Treatment was adrenalectomy in 438 (79%) of 552 Patients operated, and adrenal-sparing surgery in 114 (21%). Phaeochromocytoma recurrence occurred in four (3%) of 153 of the operated-adrenal glands after 6-13 years after surgery sparing, Compared With 11 (2%) of 717 operated by adrenalectomy glands (p = 0 · 57). Postoperative adrenal insufficiency or steroid dependency developed in 292 (86%) of 339 Patients With bilateral phaeochromocytoma WHO underwent surgery. However, 47 (57%) of 82 Patients With bilateral adrenal phaeochromocytoma WHO-sparing surgery underwent did not Become steroid dependent. Interpretation: The treatment of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2-related phaeochromocytoma Continues to Rely on adrenalectomies With Their associated Addisonian-like complications and consequent lifelong dependency on steroids. Adrenal-sparing surgery, a highly successful treatment option in experienced centers, Should be the surgical approach of choice to reduce These complications.

436;1162;Prospective Validation of a Risk Prediction Model for Severe Sepsis in Children With Cancer and High-risk Febrile Neutropenia;Background: Previously We created a model for risk prediction severe sepsis not clinically apparent During the first 24 hours of hospitalization in high-risk Children with febrile neutropenia (HRFN), Which Identified three variables, age =12 years, serum C-reactive protein ( CRP) =90 mg / L and interleukin-8 =300 pg / mL, EVALUATED at the time of admission and at 24 hours of hospitalization. The combination of These three variables Identified risk for severe sepsis to ranging from 8% to 73% with a relative risk of 3.15 (95% confidence interval: 9.06 1.1.). The aim of study was to validate esta our risk prediction model prospectively for severe sepsis in a new cohort of children with Cancer and HRFN. Methods: Predictors of severe sepsis Identified in our previous model (age, CRP and interleukin-8) Were EVALUATED at admission and at 24 hours of hospitalization in a new cohort of Children with HRFN Between April 2009 and July 2011. Diagnosis of severe sepsis, not clinically apparent During the first 24 hours of hospitalization, after discharge was made by a blind evaluator. Results: A total number of 447 episodes HRFN Were Studied, Of which 76 (17%) had a diagnosis of severe sepsis. The combination of age =12 years, CRP =90 mg / L and interleukin-8 =300 pg / mL at admission and / or at 24 hours in the new cohort at risk for severe Identified sepsis ranging from 7% to 46% With an RR of 6.7 (95% CI: 2.3.19.5). Conclusions: We validated a model for risk prediction applicable to Children with severe episodes HRFN Within the first 24 hours of admission sepsis.

437;1198;Arsenic-related DNA copy-number alterations in lung squamous cell carcinomas;Background: Lung squamous cell carcinomas (SqCCs) Occur at higher rates following arsenic exposure. Somatic DNA copy-number Alterations (CNAs) are Understood to be critical drivers in Several types tumor. We Have a rare assembled panel of lung from a population Tumors With chronic exposure arsenic, Including SQCC Tumors from Patients With no smoking history.Methods: Fifty-two lung SqCCs Were analysed by whole-genome tiling-set array comparative genomic hybridisation. Twenty-two Were derived from arsenic-exposed Patients from Northern Chile (10 never smokers and 12 smokers). Thirty additional cases for comparison Were Obtained from North American smokers without arsenic exposure. Twenty-two blood samples from healthy Individuals from Northern Chile Were Examined to identify identity germline DNA copy-number variations (CNVs) That Could be excluded from analysis.Results: We Identified multiple CNAs associated With arsenic exposure. These Alterations Were not attributable to smoking status or CNVs Either. DNA losses at chromosomes 1q21.1, 7p22.3, 9q12, and 19q13.31 Represented The most recurrent events. An arsenic-associated genes gain at 19q13.33 contains Previously Identified as oncogene candidates.Conclusions: Our results Provide a comprehensive approach to molecular Characteristics of the arsenic-exposed lung cancer genome and the non-smoking lung SQCC genome. The distinct and recurrent arsenic-related Alterations Suggest That this group of Tumors May be Considered as a separate subclass disease. © 2 Cancer Research UK.;BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANCER;2010;Artículo;Oncology;0;arsenic;lung;exposur;genom;tumor;tumor;59;12;0.0130878438331854;1;6;7;6;6;9
438;1199;Tumour cell lysate-loaded dendritic cell vaccine induces biochemical and memory immune response in castration-resistant prostate cancer patients;Background: Recently, we produced a tumor antigen-presenting cells (TAPCells) melanoma vaccine using cell lysate, called Trimel, as an antigen source and an activation factor. Tumor antigen-presenting cells induced immunological responses and Increased melanoma patient survival. Herein, we Investigated the effect of TAPCells loaded With prostate cancer cell lysates (PCCL) as an antigen source, and Trimel as a dendritic cell (DC) activation factor Which Were co-Injected With the Concholepas concholepas haemocyanin (CCH) as an adjuvant on castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients.Methods: The lysate capacity mix, for inducing T-cell activation, was analysed by flow cytometry and Elispot. Delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction against PCCL, frequency of CD8 + memory T cells (Tm) in blood and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in serum Were Measured in Treated patients.Results: The lysate mix functional mature DCs induced That Were capable of activating PCCL-specific T cells. No adverse reactions Were Observed Relevant. Six out of 14 Patients Showed a significant decrease in levels of PSA. DTH + Patients Showed a prolonged PSA doubling-time after treatment. Central expansion of CD8 + effector functional and Tm Were detected.Conclusion: Treatment of Patients With CRPC lysate-loaded TAPCells and CCH as an adjuvant is safe: generating biochemical and memory immune responses. However, the limited number of cases requires confirmation in a phase II clinical trial. © 2 Cancer Research UK.;BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANCER;2013;Artículo;Oncology;0;antigen;lysat;cancer;induc;pccl;cancer;120;4;0.0266193433895297;1;6;7;5;13;27
439;1262;Frequencies of 23 functionally significant variant alleles related with metabolism of antineoplastic drugs in the chilean population: Comparison with caucasian and asian populations;Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide. The cancer incidence rate in Chile is 133.7 / 100,000 inhabitants and it is the second cause of death, after cardiovascular diseases. Most of the antineoplastic drugs are metabolized to be detoxified, and some of them to be activated. Genetic polymorphisms of drug metabolizing enzymes can induce-deep changes in enzyme activity, leading to variability in drug efficacy individually and / or toxic-ity. The present research describe the presence of genetic polymorphisms in the Chilean population, Which Might be useful in public health programs for personalized treatment of cancer, and compare These frequencies With Those Reported for Asian and Caucasian Populations, as a contribution to the evaluation of ethnic Differences in the response to chemotherapy. We Analyzed 23 polymorphisms in a group of 253 unrelated volunteers from the overall Chilean population. The results Showed That CYP2A6 * 2, CYP2A6 * 3 * 3 CYP2D6, CYP2C19 * 3, and CYP3A4 * 17 alleles are virtually absent in variant Chileans. CYP1A1 * 2A allele frequency (0.37) is similar to That of Caucasians and higher than for Japanese people That Reported. Allele frequencies for CYP3A5 * 3 (0.76) and CYP2C9 * 3 (0.04) are similar to Those Observed in Japanese people. CYP1A1 * 2C (O.32), CYP1A2 * 1F (0.77), CYP3A4 * 1B (0.06), CYP2D6 * 2 (0.4V, and MTHFRT (0.52) allele frequencies are higher than the Observed in Caucasian Either or in Japanese Populations. conversely, CYP2C19 * 2 frequency allelic (0.12), and genotype frequencies for GSTT1 null (0.11) and GSTM1 null (0.36) are lower than Those Observed in Both Populations. Finally, allele frequencies for CYP2A6 * 4 (0.04), CYP2C8 * 3 (0.06), CYP2C9 * 2 (0.06), CYP2D6 * 4 (0.12), CYP2EV5B (0.14), CYP2E1 * 6 (0.19), and UGT2B7 * 2 (0.40) are intermediate in relation to Those Described in Caucasian and in Japanese Populations , as expected ACCORDING to the ethnic origin of the Chilean population. in conclusion, our findings support the notion That ethnic variability must be Considered in the pharmacogenomic assessment of cancer pharmacotherapy, especially in mixed Populations and for drugs with a narrow safety range. © 2012 Roco, Quiñones, Agúndez, Garcia-Martin, Squicciarini, Miranda, Garay, Farfan, Saavedra, Cáceres, Ibarr a and Varela. © 2012 Roco, Quiñones, Agúndez, Garcia-Martin, Squicciarini, Miranda, Garay, Farfan, Saavedra, Cáceres, Ibarra and Varela.;FRONTIERS IN GENETICS;2012;Artículo;Oncology;0;cypa;popul;frequenc;allel;cypc;;0;0;0;12;6;19;4;20;29
440;1263;Microarray proteomic analysis discriminates tumorigenic mouse ovarian surface epithelial cells of divergent aggressive potential;Cancer is an intrinsically heterogeneous disease. Tumors classified under the same etiology and histological type display May divergent growth and invasion properties, RESULTING in different progression rates and clinical outcomes. Here, we Approached this subject in a syngeneic mouse model of ovarian cancer. Antibody microarrays Were applied to Obtain the proteomic profiles of IF5 and IG10, two mouse ovarian surface spontaneously Transformed epithelial (MOSE) clonal cell lines of cognate origin but different tumorigenic behavior in vivo. Repeated dye-swap allowed About 40% filter out of signals from inconsistent to the total of 224 arrayed antibodies. Two-class comparison tests Resulted in 31 differentially Expressed proteins (adjusted p & lt 0.05). Proteins of the ErbB signaling pathways focal adhesion and higher levels Showed in IG10, The most aggressive cell. In contrast, the less aggressive IF5 cell was enriched in proteins related to nuclear chromatin organization and cell-cycle. Additionally, protein levels and comparison Between mRNA levels of cells MoSE Resulted in a positive correlation for 50-60% rank of protein-mRNA pairs (p & lt 1.7 × 10-5). Importantly, the protein profile of IG10 is linked to invasion and chemotherapy response in human ovarian tumors while the IF5 profile is associated to growth control. The minimal IG10 network contained the proteins Jun, Smad4, Myc, Atf2, and Pak1 as major nodes while CHEK2, Mdm2 and ccna2 Were the predominant network nodes of the IF5.

441;1264;Functional characteristics of cancer stem cells and their role in drug resistance of prostate cancer;Cancer stem cells (CSCs) Have the ability to self-renew and differentiate to give rise to heterogeneous phenotype of the tumor cells. It is Believed That These cells are Involved in Metastasis, Recurrence and therapy resistance in various cancers. CSCs Have been identified in prostate cancer (PCa), one of the MOST diagnosed malignancies in men over the world, for Which chemotherapy resistance is a major problem in the treatment of castration-resistant advanced stages. Molecular signatures, gene expression and functional features Have Been Reported for PCa CSCs. Most data from cell lines eats Which May not Represent the actual tumor. In the present work, to CSCs from PCa Obtained enriched population was functionally Characterized explants and Analyzed for drug resistance. Tumorsphere cultures positive for ABCG2 transporter, CD133, CD44, cytokeratins 5 and 18 (CK5 and CK18) and negatives for androgen receptor (AR) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) Showed higher clonogenic capacity, holoclone-forming ability, colony-forming capacity in soft agar and lower proliferative and apoptotic rate than Control adherent cell cultures. Furthermore, tumor-sphere exposing cultures to ABCG2 substrate drugs Resulted in a high survival rate Control Compared With PCa cells. This was high drug resistance using a selective inhibitor Decreased of ABCG2. According To These results, from PCa explants tumorspheres Showed a functional stem phenotype and a marked drug resistance, probably mediated by high expression of the ABCG2 transporter, Which Might Be Considered as a suitable therapeutic target for CSCs.;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY;2014;Artículo;Oncology;0;resist;cscs;pca;abcg;drug;;0;0;0;1;6;7;2;3;27

443;1360;Modulation of the response of prostate cancer cell lines to cisplatin treatment using small interfering RNA;Cisplatin is one of the MOST Widely used and effective chemotherapeutic agents against human cancers Several types of. However, the underlying Mechanisms of action are not fully Understood. We Aimed to investigate the possible molecular mechanism (s) of acquired chemoresistance Observed in prostate cancer cells Treated With Cisplatin. Human LNCaP cells (wild-type p53 bearing) and PC-3 cells (lacking p53) Were used. The levels of protein expression by western blotting Were Determined, and the mRNA levels Were Determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Cell viability was Measured by MTT assay, and the transcriptional effect of small interfering RNA (siRNA) was Measured by luciferase reporter gene. We showed That cisplatin treatment Increased JNK-1 and JNK-2 activity and expression in LNCaP and PC Both-3 cells. In Addition, the knockdown of JNK-1 expression by siRNA-JNK-1 or siRNA-JNK-2 Significantly impaired the upregulation of AP-1 luciferase reporter gene, but failed to decrease the levels of AP-1 reporter gene expression induced by TPA treatment. Our observations Indicate That JNK-1 and JNK-2 May be Involved in the chemoresistance Observed in prostate cancer cells Treated With Cisplatin and That blocking the stimulation of June kinase (JNK) signaling May be Important for regulating the susceptibility to cisplatin of prostate cancer.;ONCOLOGY REPORTS;2013;Artículo;Oncology;0;jnk;cisplatin;cancer;gene;observ;cancer;120;4;0.0266193433895297;5;5;5;2;16;13

A total number of 184 Patients in CR after anthracycline-based chemotherapy Were retrospectively Analyzed: 62 underwent CHT alone (CHT group), while 122 (66%) Patients Were Referred to cRT (CHT + RT group). After a median follow-up of 54 months, 36 Patients (20%) experienced relapse: 19% in the CHT group and 20% in the CHT + RT group. At the time of analysis 47 (76%) CHT Patients and 97 (80%) CHT + RT Patients Were alive. Five-year survival overall (OS), disease-free survival (DFS) and lymphoma-specific survival (LSS) Were 80%, 74% and 86%, respectively. Five-year OS was prolonged in the CHT Significantly + RT group, while DFS and LSS Were Similar Between groups. This discrepancy was Attributed to a high percentage of deaths due to unrelated causes in CHT patients. cRT does not prolong LSS In Patients With early-stage WR-DLBCL in CR after anthracycline-container containing chemotherapy.

445;1434;Time trends of human papillomavirus types in invasive cervical cancer, from 1940 to 2007;Contribution over time of human papillomavirus (HPV) types in human cancers has-been poorly documented. Such data is crucial to measure current HPV vaccines impact in the years to come. We HPV type-Estimated the specific distribution in a large international series of invasive cervical cancer (ICC) over 70 years prior to vaccination. Paraffin embedded ICC cases diagnosed Between 1940 and 2007 Were retrieved from Eleven Countries in Central-South America, Asia and Europe. Countries included Reported to Have low-medium cervical cancer screening uptake. Information on age at diagnosis and year of medical records was Collected from. After histological confirmation, HPV DNA detection was performed by SPF-10 / DEIA / LiPA25 (version1). Logistic regression models Were used for estimating the adjusted relative Contributions (RC) of HPV16 and HPV18 over of time. Among 4.771 HPV DNA positive ICC cases, HPV16 and HPV18 Were the two Most Common HPVs in all the Decades With No statistically significant variations of Their adjusted RC-1940-59 to 2000-07 from (HPV16 - from 61.5 to 62.1%, and HPV18 - from 6.9 to 7.2%). As well, the RC of other HPV types did not varied over time. In the stratified analysis by histology, HPV16-RC Significantly Increased adjusted across Decades in adenocarcinomas. Regarding age, cases associated to HPV16 Either 18 or 45 Were Younger Than Those With all other HPV types in the EVALUATED decades. The Observed stability on the HPV type distribution predicts a high and stable impact of HPV vaccination in reducing the burden cervical cancer in future generations vaccinated. What's new? Evaluation of the success or failure of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination programs depends in part on knowledge of the historical contribution of the different HPV types to human cancer. The present study Analyzed HPV type-specific relative to invasive cervical cancer Contributions (ICC) over a 70-year period prior to the implementation of HPV vaccination. The relative Contributions of different HPV types, Including Those for Which a vaccine is now available, Were found to be constant across decades.

Agonists activate the GnRH receptor (GnRH-R), triggering apoptosis in PCa cells. In gonadotropes, the amount of GnRH-R in the plasma membrane is regulated by protein folding and endoplasmic reticulum retention, Mechanisms That can be Overcome by the pharmacoperone IN3. Our aim was to describe the intracellular distribution of GnRH-R in PCa cells and Its relation to response to GnRH analog treatments. The expressions of GnRH-R in PCa biopsies by immunohistochemistry Were EVALUATED and the intracellular distribution was determined to by immunofluorescence in human primary cell cultures from PCa samples. Cultured cells Were pretreated With IN3 And Then With leuprolide. Cell survival was EVALUATED by 1- (4,5-dimethylthiazol-2- yl) -3,5-diphenylformazan (MTT) thiazolyl blue formazan and cell cycle and apoptosis by flow cytometry. We Observed That the expression of GnRH-R Decreased ACCORDING TO malignant progression. Most GnRH-R are located inside the cell, colocalizing With endoplasmic reticulum markers. The treatment With Decreased cellular IN3 GnRH-R retention, increase increasing plasma membrane expression in approximately 60%.

455;2308;PCA3 sensitivity and specificity for prostate cancer detection in patients with abnormal PSA and/or suspicious digital rectal examination. First Latin American experience;Introduction: Prostate Cancer Gene 3 (PCA3) is a recently Described and highly specific marker for prostate cancer urinary (CaP). Its introduction in clinical practice to supplement low specificity of prostate specific antigen (PSA) can improve increase CaP diagnosis and follow-up. However, before ITS introduction, it is Necessary to validate the method of PCA3 detection in distinct geographic Populations. Objectives: Our aim was to describe for the first time in Latin America, the application of the PROGENSA PCA3 assay for PCA3 detection in urine in Chilean men and Its utility for CaP diagnosis in men with an indication of prostate biopsy. Materials and methods: Sixty-four Chilean Patients (mean age, 64 years) With indication of prostate biopsy Because of elevated PSA and / or digital rectal examination suspicious (DRE) Were Recruited prospectively. PCA3 scores from urine samples Were Obtained Assessed after DRE, before biopsy, and PSA levels and Compared With biopsy outcome. Results: The mean value and median PSA PCA3 score Were 5.8 ng / ml and 31.7, respectively. Using a cutoff score of 35 PCA3, the sensitivity and specificity for detecting CaP Were 52% and 87%, respectively. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis Showed an area under the curve of 0.77 for PCA3 and 0.57 for PSA, for the same group of patients. In Patients With previous negative biopsy, PCA3 Increased by 2.2% specificity. Conclusions: This is the first report in Latin America on the use of PCA3 in diagnosing CaP. Our results are comparable to other Populations in Those Reported in the literature, demonstrating the reproducibility of the test.

Materials and Methods: A retrospective study of 62 was performed in Patients Patients With Pure seminoma. The retroperitoneum was staged With the scan and computed tomography Thorax x-rays With single and / or computed tomography scan. Pathologists Were unaware of the clinical stage of the patients. Manual microarrays from a tissue Were created representative of tumor. The expression of p53, Ki67, CD30, and CD117 was EVALUATED as negative, any degree of expression, and expression in more than 50% of neoplastic cells. Univariate and multivariate analysis Were performed. Results: Sixty-two cases Were Analyzed: 43 cases Were in clinical stage I (69.4%), 17 Were in clinical stage II (27.4%), and 2 Were in clinical stage III (3.2%). Fifty-six cases CD117 Expressed (90%) 42 p53 (68%), 8 CD30 (13%), and all cases Ki67. There Were no Differences in p53, Ki67, CD30, and CD117 expression testicular seminoma Between With and without clinical metastases at diagnosis, Regardless of the magnitude of expression. Neither of them found positive association Between These marker expressions and morphologic risk factors: such as tumor size greater than 6 cm and rete testis invasion. Conclusions: This study shows that expression of p53, Ki67, and CD30 expression and loss of CD117 fail to predict the presence of clinical metastases at diagnosis of testicular seminoma and do not correlate With other risk factors in clinical histopathological stage I patients.

457;2372;Whole-Genome Sequencing Analysis Identifies a Distinctive Mutational Spectrum in an Arsenic-Related Lung Tumor;INTRODUCTION :: Arsenic exposure is a significant cause of lung cancer in North America and worldwide. Arsenic-related tumors are structurally indistinguishable from induced by other carcinogens Those. Because carcinogens, like tobacco, induces distinctive mutational signatures, we Sought to characterize the mutational signature of an arsenic-related lung tumor from a never smoker With the use of whole-genome sequencing. METHODS :: tumor and lung tissues Were Obtained from a never smoker lung squamous cell carcinoma With (LUSC) without family history of lung cancer and chronically exposed to high levels of arsenic-contaminated drinking water. The Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform was used to sequence each genome at approximately 30-fold haploid coverage. The mutational signature was Compared With Those Observed in Previously Characterized lung tumors. RESULTS :: The arsenic-related tumor Exhibited in LUSC common Alterations,: such as the number of copies at Increased 3q26 (SOX2 locus). However, the arsenic-related genome not only harbored a lower number of point mutations, but Also had a remarkably high fraction of T> G / A> C mutations and low fraction of C> A / G> T transversions, Which is uncharacteristic of LUSCs. Furthermore, at the gene level, we Identified a rare G> C mutation in TP53, Which is uncommon in lung tumors in overall (<0.2%) but Has Been Observed in other arsenic-related malignancies. CONCLUSIONS :: We generated the first whole-genome sequence of an LUSC from a never-smoker chronically exposed to arsenic patient, and Identified a distinct mutational spectrum Associated With arsenic exposure, providing novel evidence supporting the hypothesis That arsenic-induced lung tumors through ARISE molecular Mechanisms That differ from Those of the common lung cancer.

459;2603;Caveolin-1 is a risk factor for postsurgery metastasis in preclinical melanoma models;Melanomas are highly lethal skin That Tumors are Treated by surgical resection Frequently. However, the efficacy of Such procedures is limited by tumor recurrence Often and metastasis. Caveolin-1 (CAV1) Has Been Attributed roles as a tumor suppressor, in late-stage, Although Tumors, ITS presence is associated With enhanced metastasis. The expression of protein in human melanoma esta development and how the presence of Particularly CAV1 metastasis after surgery Affects has not Been Defined. CAV1 expression in human melanocytes and melanomas With disease progression Increases and is highest in metastatic melanomas. The effect of CAV1 Increased expression can be then a B16F10 murine melanoma EVALUATED using cells injected into syngenic immunocompetent C57BL / 6 mice or human A375 melanoma cells injected into immunodeficient B6Rag1 - / - mice. Augmented expression CAV1 Suppresses tumor formation upon a subcutaneous injection, but Enhances lung metastasis of cells injected into the tail vein in Both models. INITIALLY A procedure was developed using B16F10 melanoma cells in C57BL / 6 mice to mimic better the situation in Patients Undergoing surgery. Subcutaneous Tumors of a defined size Were surgically removed Local and tumor recurrence and lung metastasis after another EVALUATED Were 14 days. In This postsurgery setting, B16F10 melanomas CAV1 presence in metastasis to the lung favored, tumor suppression, Although at the initial site was still evident. Similar results Were Obtained When A375 cells in Evaluating B6Rag1 - / - mice. These results implicate CAV1 expression in melanomas as a marker of poor prognosis for Patients Undergoing surgery CAV1 expression as experimental lung metastasis in two Promotes different preclinical models. © 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.;MELANOMA RESEARCH;2014;Artículo;Oncology;0;melanoma;cav;tumor;metastasi;inject;tumor;59;12;0.0130878438331854;1;6;7;6;16;27
460;2623;Genetic association of gastric cancer with miRNA clusters including the cancer-related genes MIR29, MIR25, MIR93 and MIR106: Results from the EPIC-EURGAST study;MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are post-transcriptional gene regulators Involved in a wide range of biological procesos Including tumorigenesis. Deregulation of miRNA pathways associated with Cancer has-been but the contribution of Their genetic variability to this disorder is poorly known. We Analyzed the genetic association of gastric cancer (GC) and Its anatomical and histological subtypes, with 133 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) tagging 15 isolated miRNAs and 24 miRNA clusters Potentially Involved in cancer, in 365 GC cases and 1,284 controls matched Within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition Cohort. Various Were SNPs Associated With GC under the log-additive model. Furthermore, Several of These miRNAs passed the test gene-based permutation When Analyzed ACCORDING TO GC subtypes: three tagSNPs of the miR-29A / miR-29b-1 Were cluster associated With diffuse subtype (minimum p-value = 1.7 × 10-4  odds ratio, OR = 1.72 95% confidence interval, CI = 1.30-2.28), two tagSNPs of the miR-25 / miR-93 / miR-106b associated cluster Were With cardia GC (minimum value = 5.38 p-× 10 -3 OR = 0.56, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.86 =) and one tagSNP of the miR-363 / miR-92a-2 / miR-19b-2 / miR-20b / miR-18b / miR-106a cluster was associated With noncardia GC (minimum p-value = 5.40 × 10-3, OR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.12-1.78). Some functionally target validated genes of These miRNAs are Implicated in cancer-related Processes: such as methylation (DNMT3A, DNMT3B), cell cycle (E2F1, CDKN1A, CDKN1C), apoptosis (BCL2L11, MCL1), angiogenesis (VEGF) and progression (PIK3R1, MYCN). Furthermore, we Identified genetic interactions Between variants miRNAs and tagging These variants in Their validated target genes. Deregulation of the expression of These miRNAs in GC Present supports our findings, altogether suggesting for the fist time That genetic variation in miR29, MIR25, MIR93 and MIR106b May have a critical role in genetic susceptibility to GC and Could Contribute to the Molecular Mechanisms of gastric carcinogenesis. What's New? Even though deregulation of miRNA expression Has Been Associated With human cancers, the contribution of miRNAs to cancer genetic susceptibility is unclear. Here the authors designed a panel of 133 miRNA 104 SNPs tagging candidate genes and analysed Their association with gastric cancer (GC). They describe an unreported significant genetic association of GC With miRNA clusters in chromosomes 7 and miR-29 X Including, miR-25, miR-93, miR-106 and. These miRNAs Have Been Previously Involved in the pathophysiology of GC and Have functionally validated target genes Implicated in cancer-related processes.

461;2626;Rab5 activation promotes focal adhesion disassembly, migration and invasiveness in tumor cells;Migration and invasion are essential steps associated tumor cell metastasis and With Increasing evidence points towards endosome trafficking being essential in esta process. Indeed, the small GTPase Rab5, a crucial regulator of early endosome dynamics, Promotes cell migration in vitro and in vivo. Precisely how Rab5 Participates In These events remains to be determined. Considering focal adhesions That Represent structures crucial to cell migration, we Rab5 activation Specifically Whether Asked focal adhesion disassembly and thereby Promoted Facilitated migration and invasion of metastatic cancer cells. Pulldown and biosensor assays revealed That Rab5-GTP Increased loading at the leading edge of migrating tumor cells. Additionally, targeting of Rab5 by different shRNA sequences, but not shRNA Control, Decreased Rab5-GTP levels, leading to reduced cell spreading, migration and invasiveness. Reexpression in knockdown cells of wild-type Rab5, but not the S34N mutant (GDP-bound), restored These properties. Importantly, Rab5 association with the focal adhesion proteins vinculin and paxillin Increased During migration, and expression of wild-type, but not GDPbound Rab5, focal adhesion disassembly accelerated, as well as FAK dephosphorylation on tyrosine 397. Finally, Rab5-driven invasiveness focal required adhesion disassembly, as FAK inhibitor treatment With the number 14 preventer Matrigel matrix metalloproteinase invasion and release. Taken together, These observations show That Rab5 activation is required to Enhance cancer cell migration and invasion by focal adhesion disassembly Promoting. © 2 Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.;JOURNAL OF CELL SCIENCE;2013;Artículo;Oncology;0;rab;migrat;adhes;focal;invas;;0;0;0;5;5;7;9;16;4

464;2822;Impact of CYP1A1, GSTM1, and GSTT1 polymorphisms in overall and specific prostate cancer survival;Objective: Prognostic Biomarkers That distinguish Between Patients with good or poor outcome can be used to guide decisions of Whom to treat and how aggressively. In This sense, Several genetic polymorphisms Proposed Have groups as potential susceptibility and prognostic biomarkers however, you have not Been Their proven validity. THUS, the main goal of the present work was to investigate the potential role of single and combined CYP1A1, GSTM1, GSTT1 genotypes and as modifiers of cancer survival in Chilean Patients With Prostate Cancer. Methods and materials: A total number of 260 histologically confirmed Patients Were Recruited from a voluntary screening, and genomic DNA was Obtained from blood samples for genotyping Their analyzes to detect the CYP1A1 * 2A polymorphism and GSTM1 and GSTT1 deletions. The progression of illness and mortality Were Estimated with a median follow-up of 8.82 years. Adjusted Estimated genotype Risks Were EVALUATED by hazard ratio and 95% CI using the Cox proportional model. In Addition, the Kaplan-Meier survival method and log-rank test Were Used to Evaluate patient survival With regard to genotype. Results: The 9-year overall and specific survival rates Were 67.6% and 36.6% in the GSTT1null group, 67.6% and 58.7% in the GSTM1non-null group, 69.0% and 51.6% in the * 1A / * 2A group, 63.9% and 61.5% in the *. 2A / * 2A group vs. 76.2% and 62.3% in the GSTT1non-null group, 82.3% and 50% in the GSTM1null group, and 83.7% and 56.3% in the * 1A / * 1A group, respectively. The hazard ratios and the Kaplan-Meier curve results Demonstrate That the GSTM1non-null, GSTT1null, and CYP1A1 * 2A genotypes are associated Significantly With mortality. Our study has two main limitations: a Relatively small sample size and a low overall percentage mortality (25.4%) THUS, we need to continue the follow-up to confirm These findings. Conclusions: Our results Suggest That the GSTM1non-null, GSTT1null, and CYP1A1 * 2A genotypes May be good prognosis markers, Particularly in Patients With high-risk tumors. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.;UROLOGIC ONCOLOGY-SEMINARS AND ORIGINAL INVESTIGATIONS;2014;Artículo;Oncology;0;genotyp;cypa;null;surviv;gstmnon;;0;0;0;1;6;19;2;25;29
465;3028;Tyrosine kinase A receptor (trkA): A potential marker in epithelial ovarian cancer;Objectives: To Evaluate the role of trkA receptor as a potential tumor marker in epithelial serous ovarian cancer and Its Relationship With the angiogenic factors expression as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and nerve growth factor (NGF). Additionally, to examine Whether NGF and VEGF secreted by epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) explants and from ovarian epithelial cancer cell line (A2780) are Involved in the process of angiogenesis, Such as cellular proliferation, migration and differentiation of the human endothelial cell line ( EA.hy926). Methods: The mRNA levels of VEGF, NGF and trkA receptors Were Measured using PCR in 60 ovarian samples. Cellular localization and semi-quantitative estimation of VEGF, NGF, trkA and all p-trkA was performed using IHC in epithelial cells. NGF, trkA and all p-trkA Were protein in endothelial cells EVALUATED Also from the same tissues. Human endothelial cell line was cultured EA.hy926 With Obtained from conditioned media EOC Both explants and from the A2780 cell line, with or without NGF stimulus. Results: Significantly higher levels of NGF, trkA and all p-trkA protein expressions Were Observed in epithelial and endothelial cells in poorly Differentiated EOC vs normal ovary. Interestingly, the p-trkA receptor expression level Showed The most significant difference was only and Its presence found in borderline tumor and EOC samples indicating the Importance of trkA receptor in EOC marker as a potential tumor. A significant Increase in proliferation, migration and differentiation of cells was EA.hy926 Observed With NGF, And This effect was reverted Significantly When immuno-NGF was blocked and when to a trkA inhibitor was used, showing NGF That is an angiogenic factor in EOC Important by activating ITS trkA receptor. Conclusion: These results Indicate p-trkA That May be Considered as a new tumor marker in potential EOC, and That May NGF act as a direct Present angiogenic factor in EOC. © 2 Elsevier Inc.;GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY;2011;Artículo;Oncology;0;trka;ngf;eoc;endotheli;epitheli;;0;0;0;5;5;5;2;19;36
466;3149;Runx2, p53, and pRB Status as Diagnostic Parameters for Deregulation of Osteoblast Growth and Differentiation in a New Pre-Chemotherapeutic Osteosarcoma Cell Line (OS1);The most prevalent are osteosarcoma bone tumors found in primary pediatric patients. Their molecular etiology to Understand, cell culture models are used to define disease under controlled conditions Mechanisms. Many osteosarcoma cell lines (e.g., SAOS-2, U2OS, MG63) are derived from Caucasian patients. However, individually and ethnic Patients exhibit Differences in Their responsiveness to irradiation and chemotherapy. Thismotivated the establishment of osteosarcoma cell lines (OS1, OS2, OS3) from three ethnically Chinese patients.OS1 cells, derived from a pre-tumor chemotherapeutic in the femur of a 6-year-old female, Were Examined for molecular markers characteristic for osteoblasts , stem cells, and cell cycle by controlling immunohistochemistry, reverse transcriptase-PCR, Western blotting and flow cytometry.OS1 Have G-banded karyotypes aberrant, possibly reflecting chromosomal abnormalities related to p53 deficiency. OS1 ADH ossification Similar to human fetal osteoblasts profiles rather than Saos-2 Which ossifies ab initio (P <0.05). Absence of p53 expression correlates With Increased Runx2, while the slow proliferation of cells OS1 is attenuated by pRB Perhaps retention.

467;3242;Oral cancer susceptibility associated with the CYP1A1 and GSTM1 genotypes in Chilean individuals;Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) contained in tobacco smoke acquire carcinogenicity following Their activation by xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes to-highly reactive metabolites. The P4501A1 cytochrome (CYP1A1) enzyme center is to the metabolic activation of PAHs These, and GSTM1 is the main enzyme responsible for detoxification ITS. CYP1A1 and GSTM1 polymorphisms Were EVALUATED in 124 healthy controls and 48 Chilean oral Cancer Patients through PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism. In the healthy controls, frequencies of the CYP1A1 variant alleles for m1 (CYP1A1 * 2A) and the GSTM1null Genotype Were found to be 0.25 and 0.19, respectively. Patients in the oral cancer, Were These frequencies 0.33 and 0.50, respectively. THUS, the GSTM1 and m1 rare alleles Were significantly more frequent in the oral Cancer Patients Compared to the controls. The Estimated risk for oral cancer relative Associated With the single genotype CYP1A1 or GSTM1 was 2.08 for wt / m1, 1.04 for m1 / m1 and 4.16 for the GSTM1null genotype. For smokers, the relative risk Estimated (adjusted by age and gender) was higher in the Individuals carrying the allele of CYP1A1 m1 [wt / m1: odds ratio (OR) = 5.68, P = 0.0080 m1 / m1: OR = 7.77, P = 0.0420] or GSTM1null genotype (OR = 20.81, P <0.0001).

The objective of este informe is to report a low-grade primary pituitary lymphoma, diagnostic problems and to give more evidence About the evolution of esta rare disease. A 49 y.o. woman was Referred to our clinic symptoms of hypopituitarism With. A diagnostic work-up Showed mild anemia, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 122 mm / h and a negative Elisa test for HIV. Panhypopituitarism was confirmed and the MRI Showed 20 mm seal and suprasellar Enhancing mass with a thickening of the pituitary stalk, chiasmal bitemporal hemianopia and compression. She underwent transsphenoidal resection only 10 months later for non medical reasons. During esta she was clinically asymptomatic period on hormone replacement therapy. A new MRI Showed regression of the suprasellar extension and invasion to the cavernous sinus left. A firm and infiltrative mass was found During transsphenoidal surgery, and only partial resection was performed. Biopsy Showed a low-grade lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. Staging was negative for other localizations. She was localized radiotherapy and chemotherapy Given. Four years after surgery, the seal MRI Showed a 10 mm residual mass seal With the persistence of a cavernous sinus invasion and she is Considered to be in remission.

469;3291;Progesterone promotes focal adhesion formation and migration in breast cancer cells through induction of protease-activated receptor-1;Progesterone and progestins Have Been Demonstrated to Enhance breast cancer cell migration, the mech- anisms, Although are still not fully Understood. The protease-activated receptors (PARs) are a family of membrane receptors are activated by serine That proteases in the blood coagulation cascade. PAR1 (F2R) Has Been Reported to be Involved in cancer cell migration and overexpressed in breast cancer. We Demonstrate That HEREIN PAR1 mRNA and protein are upregulated by progesterone treatment of the breast cancer cell lines T47D and ZR-75. This regulation is dependent on the progesterone receptor (PR) but does not require PR phosphorylation at serine 294 or the PR proline-rich region mpro. The Increase in PAR1 mRNA was transient, being present at 3 h and returning to basal levels at 18 h. The Addition of a PAR1-activating peptide (aPAR1) to cells Treated With Resulted in an Increase Progesterone in focal adhesion (FA) formation as Measured by the cellular levels of phosphorylated kinase FA. The combined but not single treatment of progesterone and aPAR1 Also markedly Increased stress fiber formation and the migratory capacity of breast cancer cells. In agreement With in vitro findings, data mining revealed from the Oncomine platform PAR1 That expression was upregulated in PR Significantly-positive breast tumors.

470;3305;Increased SNAIL expression and low syndecan levels are associated with high Gleason grade in prostate cancer;Prostate cancer (PC) is a leading male wideworld oncologic malignancy. During malignant transformation, Normal epithelial cells undergo genetic and morphological changes as epithelial-mesenchymal Known transition (EMT). Several regulatory genes and specific marker proteins are Involved in PC EMT. Recently, syndecans Have Been Associated With malignancy grade and Gleason score in PC. Considering That SNAIL is mainly a repressor gene Increased in PC and syndecan That putative binding sites Promoters Have For This repressor, we propose SNAIL That Might Regulate During PC EMT syndecan expression. The aim of study was to analyze esta immunochemically the expression of SNAIL, syndecans 1 and 2 and other EMT markers in a tissue microarray (TMA) of PC and PC cell lines samples. The TMAs included PC samples of different Gleason grade and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) samples, as non-malignant controls.

471;3306;Molecular signature of cancer stem cells isolated from prostate carcinoma and expression of stem markers in different Gleason grades and metastasis;Prostate cancer (PCa) is the Most Frequently diagnosed malignancy in men worldwide. Chemotherapy response is very poor and resistance to hormone-based treatments is frequent in advances stages. Recently, tumor-initiating cells or cancer stem cells (CSCs) Have been identified in cancers Several, Including PCa. These cells are thought to be responsible for therapy resistance, relapse and metastasis. In the present work, enriched Populations of CSCs Were Obtained using a mixed procedure included differential That clone-forming ability, growing sphere induction (prostatospheres) and magnetic-associated cell sorting (MACS). Also, stem marker expression in PCa was determined to biopsies of different histological grades and metastasis samples. The signature for stem markers of the isolated CD133 + CSCs was / CD44 + / ABCG2 + / CD24. Expression of stem markers (CD133, CD44, and ABCG2) was higher than in medium Gleason biopsies in lower and higher grades, and lymph-node metastasis and bone samples. These results Suggest That the CSCs in PCa reach an Important number in medium Gleason grades, When the tumor is still confined into the gland. At this stage, the surgical treatment is curative Usually With intention. However, an Important percentage of relapse after treatment Patients.

Consistent With This interaction, PTOV1 was associated ribosomes and Its overexpression With Promoted overall protein synthesis in cancer cells and prostate COS-7 fibroblasts in a manner mTORC1-dependent. Transfection of ectopic expression of PTOV1 enhanced the c-Jun protein without Affecting the levels of c-Jun mRNA or RACK1. Conversely, knockdown of PTOV1 Caused significant declines in overall protein synthesis and c-Jun protein levels. High levels of PTOV1 motility and invasiveness stimulated the cancer cells of prostate, Which required c-Jun, Whereas knockdown of PTOV1 strongly inhibited the tumorigenic and metastatic potentials of PC-3 prostate cancer cells. In human prostate cancer samples, the expression of high levels of PTOV1 in primary and metastatic tumors was Significantly Increased nuclear localization associated With active of c-Jun.

474;3354;Heat-Shock Induction of Tumor-Derived Danger Signals Mediates Rapid Monocyte Differentiation into Clinically Effective Dendritic Cells;Purpose: This study characterizes, biologically and clinically, a novel type of dendritic cells (DC) produced in the short term and called tumor antigen-presenting cells (TAPCells). In particularly, we present in a Identified factors derived from lysate heat-shocked allogeneic melanoma cells (Trimel) That are associated With TAPCells' enhanced capability to induce CD8 + T-cell responses in vitro and in vaccinated melanoma patients. Experimental Design: First, extensive phenotypic and functional characterization of TAPCells was performed, followed by vaccination of 45 melanoma Patients With four doses over a period of TAPCells of 2 months. Delayed-type hypersensitivity Specific (DTH) reaction was Analyzed posttreatment and overall survival rates correlated With. Furthermore, heat-shock (HS) -induced factors present in Trimel and Their effects on DC activation Were Identified and Studied. Results: Trimel induced to Committed, mature, DC-like phenotype in TAPCells and melanoma-specific Effectively activated CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. Clinically, 64% of vaccinated Patients Showed positive DTH reaction against Trimel, and This was associated With improved overall survival. HS treatment of tumor cells Increased calreticulin (CRT) and plasma membrane translocation induced the release of high mobility group box-1 proteins (HMGB1). Both CRT and HMGB1 associated With enhanced mobilization Were TAPCells' maturation and antigen (Ag) cross-presentation, respectively. DTH analysis revealed the presence infiltration of CD8 + / CD45RO + T cells, just thus confirming TAPCells' ability to cross-present Ags in vivo. Conclusions: Our results Indicate That lysates derived from heat-shocked tumor cells are an optimal source of tumor-associated Ags, Which are crucial for the generation of DCs With improved Ag cross-presentation capacity and clinically effective immunogenicity. © 2011 AACR.;CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH;2011;Artículo;Oncology;0;tapcel;present;induc;melanoma;trimel;induc;54;14;0.0119787045252884;1;6;7;8;13;27
475;3364;Guideline for the Management of Fever and Neutropenia in Children With Cancer and/or Undergoing Hematopoietic Stem-Cell Transplantation;Purpose: To Develop an evidence-based guideline for the empiric management of pediatric fever and neutropenia (FN). Methods: The International Pediatric Fever and Neutropenia Guideline Panel is a multidisciplinary and multinational group composed of experts in pediatric oncology and infectious disease as well as a patient advocate. The Panel was convened for the purpose of creating esta guideline. We followed procedures for creating Previously Validated evidence-based guidelines. Working groups focused on initial presentation, ongoing management, and empiric antifungal therapy. Each working group developed key clinical questions, Conducted systematic reviews of the published literature, and compiled evidence summaries. The Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach was used to generate summaries, and evidence was classified as high, moderate, low, or very low based on Methodologic considerations. Results: Recommendations Were Made related to initial presentation (risk stratification, initial evaluation, and treatment), ongoing management (modification and cessation of empiric antibiotics), and empiric antifungal treatment (risk stratification, evaluation, and treatment) of pediatric FN. For each recommendation, the strength of the recommendation and level of evidence are presented. Conclusion: This guideline Represents an evidence-based approach to FN specific to children with Cancer. , Although some Recommendations are similar to adult-based guidelines, there are key distinctions in multiple areas. Implementation will require the adaptation to the local context. © 2012 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.;JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY;2012;Artículo;Oncology;0;evid;guidelin;base;recommend;empir;;0;0;0;9;8;9;1;27;1
476;3383;Rab5 is required in metastatic cancer cells for Caveolin-1-enhanced Rac1 activation, migration and invasion;Rab5 is a small GTPase That Regulates early endosome trafficking and other cellular Processes, Including cell adhesion and migration. Specifically, Rab5 Promotes Rac1 activation and cancer cell migration, but little is Known About the upstream regulators of Rab5. That We Have Previously shown the scaffolding protein Caveolin-1 (CAV1) Promotes Rac1 activation and migration of cancer cells. Here, we hypothesized That Stimulates CAV1 Rab5 activation, leading to Increased Rac1 activity and cell migration. Expression of CAV1 in B16-F10 mouse melanoma and HT-29 (US) human colon adenocarcinoma cells Increased the GTP loading of Rab5, Whereas shRNA-mediated targeting of endogenous CAV1 in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells Decreased Rab5-GTP levels. Accordingly, shRNA-mediated downregulation of Rab5 Decreased CAV1 Rac1-mediated activation, cell migration and invasion in B16-F10 and HT-29 (US) cells. Expression of CAV1 was Accompanied by Increased recruitment of Tiam1, Rac1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) to Rab5-positive early endosomes. Using the NSC23766 inhibitor, Tiam1 was shown to be required for Rac1 activation and cell migration induced by CAV1 and Rab5. Mechanistically, evidence implicating We provide p85a (Also known as PIK3R1), Rab5 GTPase to-activating protein (GAP), in CAV1-dependent effects, by showing That CAV1 recruits p85a, precluding Rab5 p85a-mediated inactivation and cell migration increase increasing. In summary, a novel These studies identify identity CAV1-Rab5-Rac1 signaling axis, whereby CAV1 Prevents Rab5 inactivation, leading to Rac1 activity and Increased tumor cell migration and enhanced invasion. © 2014.

477;3406;Association of genetic variants at TOX3, 2q35 and 8q24 with the risk of familial and early-onset breast cancer in a South-American population;Recent Genome-Wide Association Studies Have Identified Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated With breast cancer (BC) Among women of Asian, European, and African-American ancestry. NEVERTHELESS, the contribution of These variants in the South American population is unknown. Furthermore, there is little information About the effect of These risk alleles in BC Women with early diagnosis. In the present study, we EVALUATED the association Between rs3803662 (TOX3, Also known as TNRC9), rs13387042 (2q35), and rs13281615 (8q24) With BC risk in Chilean 344 BRCA1 / 2 BC-negative cases and in 801 controls. Two SNPs, rs3803662 and rs13387042, Were Significantly Associated With Increased risk in familial BC BC and in non-familial early-onset BC. The risk of BC Increased in a dose-dependent manner With the number of risk alleles (P-trend <0.0001 and 0.0091, respectively). The odds ratios for BC in BC and in familial early-onset familial non-BC Were 3.76 (95% CI 1.02-13.84, P = 0.046) and 8.0 (95% CI 2.20-29.04, P = 0.002), respectively, for the minimum versus maximum number of risk alleles. These results Indicate an additive effect of the TOX3 rs3803662 and rs13387042 2q35 alleles for BC risk. We Also EVALUATED the rs3803662 and rs13387042 Interaction Between SNPs. We Observed only an additive interaction in non-familial early-onset cases BC (AP = 0.72 (0.28-1.16), P = 0.001). No significant association was Observed for rs13281615 (8q24) With BC risk in women from the Chilean population.

RUNX2 attenuates Stimulates growth and maturation of osteoblasts During bone formation but is robustly Also Expressed in a subset of osteosarcomas, as well as in metastatic breast and prostate tumors. To ASSESS the biological function of RUNX2 in osteosarcoma cells, we Examined human genomic promoter for RUNX2 interactions using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis -microarray in Saos-2 cells. Promoter binding of RNA polymerase Both RUNX2 and II was Compared With gene expression profiles of cells in RUNX2 Which was depleted by RNA interference. Many RUNX2-bound loci (1550 of 2339 total) exhibit promoter occupancy by RNA polymerase II and Contain the RUNX consensus motif 5 '- ((T / A / C) G (T / A / C) GG (T / G). gene Ontology analysis Indicates That RUNX2 controls components of multiple signaling pathways (eg WNT, TGF, TNFa, and interleukins), as well as genes linked to cell motility and adhesion (eg focal the adhesion-related genes FAK / PTK2 and TLN1).

The growth suppressive potential of Runx2 is normally inactivated in part by protein destabilization, Which Permits cell cycle progression beyond the G1 / S phase transition, and Runx2 is up-regulated again after mitosis. Also Runx2 expression correlates With metastasis and poor chemotherapy response in osteosarcoma. Here we show human osteosarcoma cell That six lines (OSAS, MG63, U2OS, HOS, G292, and 143B) Have different growth rates, Which is consistent With Differences in the lengths of the cell cycle. Runx2 protein levels are cell cycle-regulated With respect to the G1 / S phase transition in U2OS, HOS, G292, and 143B cells. In contrast, Runx2 protein levels are constitutively Expressed During the cell cycle in SaOS and MG63 cells.

However, estrogen-induced cell proliferation in the uterus and mammary gland cancer Increases the risk of development in These organs. The lower incidence of mammary cancer in Asian women as Compared with western women Has Been Attributed to high intake of soy isoflavones, genistein Including. We Have Previously shown That genistein induces an estradiol-like cells of uterine hypertrophy, but does not induce cell proliferation, uterine eosinophilia, endometrial or edema. It Also Inhibits estradiol-induced mitosis in uterine cells and hormone-induced uterine eosinophilia and endometrial edema. NEVERTHELESS, genistein Stimulates growth of human breast cancer cells in culture THEREFORE, it is not an ideal place for use in hormone estrogen replacement therapy (HRD). The present study Investigated the effect of another soy isoflavone, daidzein (subcutaneous, 0066 mg / kg body weight), in the same Animal model, and Its effect on responses induced by subsequent treatment (1 h later) With estradiol-17ß (E2 subcutaneous, 0.33 mg / kg body weight). In Addition, we Investigated the effects of daidzein (1 ug / mL) or E 2 on the growth of human breast cancer cells in culture.

482;3622;The BARD1 Cys557Ser variant and risk of familial breast cancer in a South-American population;Since the discovery of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, much work Has Been Carried out to Identify further breast cancer (BC) susceptibility genes. BARD1 (BRCA1-associated ring domain) was originally Identified as a BRCA1-interacting protein but has Also Been Described in tumor-suppressive functions independent of BRCA1. Some association studies Have Suggested That the BARD1 variant Cys557Ser Might Be Associated With Increased Risk of BC, but others failed to confirm esta Have finding. To date, This variant has not Been Analyzed in Spanish or South-American Populations. In This study, using a case-Control design, we Analyzed the C-terminal 322 Cys557Ser change in Chilean BC cases mutations in BRCA1 With No or BRCA2 and in 570 controls in order to, evaluate- ITS possible association with BC susceptibility. BARD1 Cys557Ser was associated With An Increased risk BC (P = 0.04, OR = 3.4 [95% CI 1.2-10.2]) Among cases Belonging to families with a strong family history of BC. No Difference between single cases AFFECTED with age <50 years at diagnosis (n = 117) and controls was Observed for carriers of Cys / Ser genotype. It is likely That variant is not esta BC Involved in this group of risk in women. We Also Analyzed to possible interaction Between BARD1 557Ser / XRCC3 241Met Considering the role variants of Both genes in the maintenance of genome integrity.

483;3699;Intradermal DNA electroporation induces survivin-specific CTLs, suppresses angiogenesis and confers protection against mouse melanoma;Survivin is an intracellular tumor-associated antigen is broadly That Expressed in a large variety of tumors and tumor endothelial Also in mostly associated cells but absent in Differentiated tissues. Naked DNA vaccines targeting survivin Have Been shown to induce T cell as well as humoral immune responses in mice. However, the lack of epitope-specific CD8 + T cell tumor detection and modest protection highlight the need for Observed further improvements to Develop Effective Approaches survivin DNA vaccination. Here, the efficacy of a human survivin DNA vaccine delivered by intradermal electroporation (EP) was tested. The CD8 + T cell epitope surv20-28 restricted to H-2 Db was based on Identified in-silico epitope prediction algorithms and binding to MHC class I molecules. Intradermal DNA EP of mice with a plasmid encoding human survivin generated CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses cross-reactive epitope with the Mouse surv20-28, as Determined by intracellular IFN-<U+03B3> staining, suggesting That self-tolerance has-been broken. Survivin-specific CTLs displayed as an activated effector phenotype CD44 and CD107 Determined by up-regulation. Vaccinated mice displayed cytotoxic activity against B16 specific and peptide-pulsed RMA-S cells in vitro as well as against surv20-28 peptide-pulsed target cells in vivo.

In the Chilean population, there are only two reports of Mutation analysis of BRCA1 / 2, and These included a low number of BC and / or OC patients. , Moreover, the prevalence of BRCA1 / 2 genomic rearrangements in Chilean and in other South American Populations is unknown. In this article, we present the mutation-detection data Corresponding to a set of 326 high-risk families Analyzed by conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis and heteroduplex analysis. To determine the contribution of BRCA1 / 2 LGRs in Chilean Patients BC, we Analyzed 56 high-risk subjects With no pathogenic BRCA1 / 2 point mutations. Germline BRCA1 / 2 mutations point Were found in 23 (7.1%) of the 326 Chilean families. Families Which HAD At least three BC and / or OC cases Showed the highest frequency of mutations (15.9%). We Identified 14 point pathogenic mutations. Three mutations in BRCA1 recurrent (c.187-188delAG, c.2605-2606delTT, and c.3450-3453 delCAAG) and three in BRCA2 (c.4969-4970insTG, c.5374-5377delTATG, and c.6503-6504delTT) Contributed to 63.6 and 66.7% of all the deleterious mutations of each gene, Which May Reflect the presence of region-specific founder effects.

485;3850;Inactivation of the putative suppressor gene DOK1 by promoter hypermethylation in primary human cancers;The DOK1 gene is a putative tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 2p13 the human Frequently Which is rearranged in leukemia and other human Tumors. We Previously Reported That the DOK1 gene can be mutated and Its down-regulated expression in human malignancies. However, the underlying mechanism remains Largely unknown DOK1 silencing. We show here Silencing of DOK1 unscheduled That expression through aberrant hypermethylation is a frequent event in a variety of human malignancies. DOK1 was found to be silenced in nine head and neck cancer (HNC) cell lines and DOK1 CpG hypermethylation Studied With correlated loss of gene expression in cells in Original. Could be restored DOK1 expression via demethylating treatment using 5-aza-2'deoxycytidine. In Addition, transduction of cancer cell lines with impaired DOK1 Their proliferation, consistent With the critical role of epigenetic silencing of DOK1 in the development and maintenance of malignant cells. We further Observed That DOK1 hypermethylation OCCURS Frequently in a variety of primary human neoplasm Including solid Tumors (93% in HNC, 81% in lung cancer) and haematopoietic malignancy (64% in Burkitt's lymphoma). Control blood samples and exfoliated epithelial cells from healthy mouth Individuals Showed a low level of DOK1 methylation, suggesting DOK1 That hypermethylation is a tumor specific event. Finally, an inverse correlation was Observed Between the level of DOK1 gene methylation and Its expression in tumor and adjacent non tumor tissues. THUS, hypermethylation of DOK1 is a critical event in human carcinogenesis Potentially, and may be a potential cancer biomarker and an attractive target for epigenetic-based therapy.

That Suppresses CAV1 genes for tumor development, yet Also Promotes focal adhesion turnover and migration of metastatic cells. How These contrasting observations relate to CAV1 function in vivo is unclear. Our previous studies implicate E-cadherin in CAV1-dependent tumor suppression. Here, we use murine B16F10 melanoma cells, with low levels of endogenous CAV1 and E-cadherin, to unravel how CAV1 Affects tumor growth and metastasis and to ASSESS how co-expression of E-cadherin modulates CAV1 function in vivo in C57BL / 6 mice .

491;4321;Toll-like receptor 4 gene polymorphism influences dendritic cell in vitro function and clinical outcomes in vaccinated melanoma patients;Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is Expressed on dendritic cells (DCs), environmental sensing molecules induces danger That Their activation and maturation. Recently, we reported almost a method for the production of therapeutic DCs against melanoma cells called tumor antigenpresenting (TAPCells), using a heat-shocked allogeneic melanoma cell lysate (Trimel) as an activation factor and antigen provider. Since Trimel contains endogenous TLR4 ligands, we EVALUATED the role of TLR4 in TAPCells differentiation by antibody neutralization and the association of TLR4 polymorphism (896A / G) (Asp299Gly) Determined by PCR-RFLP, with the in vitro activation capacity and the clinical TAPCellsvaccinated outcome of patients. Antibody blocking of monocyte TLR4 expression inhibited surface, Determined by flow cytometry, of the major histocompatibility complex class I, CCR7, CD80, CD83 and CD86 on TAPCells, interleukin reduced (IL) -6 and tumor necrosis factor -a gene expression by qRT EVALUATED -PCR, and Present inhibited the interferon-<U+03B3> TAPCellsmediated (IFN-<U+03B3>) secretion of melanoma-specific CD8 + T cells by ELISpot Determined (p & lt 0.01). , Moreover, CD8 + T-cell activation was Significantly reduced capacity in TLR4 Asp299Gly TAPCells bearing the receptor (p & lt 0.05). Finally, TAPCells-vaccinated stage IV melanoma-bearing Patients Showed the Tlr4 896G allele shortened to mediate post-therapy survival rate Compared With Those carrying the Tlr4 896A allele (p & lt 0.05 log-rank test). Our results Indicate That TLR4 is a key receptor for the tumor lysate-mediated in vitro generation of antigen-presenting clinically efficient cells.

385;1740;Auditory Nerve Frequency Tuning Measured with Forward-Masked Compound Action Potentials;Frequency selectivity is a critical Cochlear property. Recent studies using otoacoustic Emissions and psychophysical forward masking Suggest That is sharper frequency selectivity in human than in common laboratory species. This has-been disputed based on compound action potentials reports using (CAPs), Which Reflect activity in the auditory nerve and can be Measured in humans. Comparative data of CAPs, Obtained with a variety of simultaneous masking protocols, Have Been Interpreted to Indicate similarity of frequency tuning across mammals and even birds. Unfortunately, there are issues with the available Several measurements Which CAP hamper a straightforward comparison across species. We investigate sharpness of CAP tuning in cat and chinchilla using a forward notched-noise masking paradigm- Which is less confounded by Cochlear nonlinearities than simultaneousmasking Paradigms and similar to what was used in the study reporting psychophysical tuning sharper in humans. Our parametric study, using different frequencies and notch widths probe, shows consistent relationships With auditory nerve fibers of Those (ANFs). The sharpness of tuning, Quantified by Q10 factors, is negatively correlated With level probe and probe Increases With frequency, but the Q10 values <U+200B><U+200B>are lower than the average Generally trend for ANFs. Like the single fiber data, tuning in for CAPs is sharper than in chinchilla cat, but the two species are like in the dependence of frequency and tuning on probe in the relationship Between tuning in ANFs and CAP.

Medial and lateral OC neurons make synapses with outer hair cells and auditory nerve fibers With, respectively. In Addition to the OC system, there are Also descending from the auditory cortex projections are directed towards the That thalamus, inferior colliculus, cochlear nucleus, and superior olivary complex. Olivocochlear function can be Assessed by measuring a reflex mediated by brainstem auditory nerve fibers, cochlear nucleus neurons, and OC fibers. , Although it is Known That the OC reflex is activated by contralateral acoustic stimulation and produces a suppression of cochlear responses, the influence of cortical descending pathways in the OC reflex is Largely unknown. Here, we used auditory cortex electrical microstimulation in chinchillas to study a possible cortical modulation of cochlear and auditory nerve responses to tones in the absence and presence of contralateral noise. We found That cortical microstimulation produces two different peripheral modulations: (i) changes in Cochlear sensitivity evidenced by amplitude modulation of cochlear microphonics and auditory nerve compound action potentials and (ii) enhancement or suppression of the OC reflex strength as Measured by auditory nerve responses, Which Depend on the intersubject variability of the OC reflex. , Moreover, corticofugal Both effects Were not correlated, suggesting the presence of two functionally different efferent pathways. These results Demonstrate That auditory cortex modulates the electrical microstimulation Independently OC cochlear reflex strength and sensitivity. © 2015 Association for Research in Otolaryngology;JARO-JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR RESEARCH IN OTOLARYNGOLOGY;2015;Artículo;Otorhinolaryngology;0;auditori;cochlear;reflex;nerv;fiber;;0;0;0;3;6;3;9;23;40

398;2993;Xylene-Induced Auditory Dysfunction in Humans;Objectives: Animal Data Indicate That Xylene Cochlear induces dysfunction, Characterized by the loss of outer hair cells. There is little evidence Xylene-induced ototoxicity Regarding in humans. The aim of the study was to investigate the possible adverse effects of xylene on the peripheral and central auditory system in humans. Design: A Total of 30 medical laboratory workers exposed to Who Had Been a mixture of xylene isomers, Together with 30 nonexposed participants matched for controlling gender, age, and educational level Were selected. Participants of Both groups Were not exposed to noise levels above 85 dBA time-weighted average. EVALUATED Were all participants with a comprehensive audiological test battery, included Measures Which of peripheral and central auditory function. Peripheral auditory Measures included pure-tone audiometry and otoacoustic distortion product Emissions. Behavioral Measures of Central auditory function included a pitch pattern sequence test, an adaptive test of temporal resolution, a dichotic digit test, and a masking level difference test. The auditory brainstem response was used to objectively Evaluate the function of the auditory pathways at the brainstem level. Speech perception in quiet and in noise was EVALUATED using the Hearing In Noise Test (HINT). The xylene-exposed participants Were extensively EVALUATED With regard to Their exposure to noise and xylene Both. Noise dosimetry was Conducted over an 8-hr shift work to Obtain noise-exposure levels for each worker Xylene-exposed. Xylene Airborne Concentrations Were Obtained at 11 different workstations Throughout the medical laboratories, and methyl hippuric acid per gram of creatinine levels in urine Were Obtained for each Xylene-exposed subject. Finally, a detailed interview current and past exploring solvent and noise exposure was Conducted. Results: The Xylene-exposed participants Showed Significantly worse pure-tone thresholds in comparison With the nonexposed participants. The xylene-exposed participants Demonstrated Significantly worse results than the Control group participants for the pitch pattern sequence test, dichotic digit test, HINT, and the auditory brainstem response (absolute and interpeak latencies). No significant Differences Between the exposed and nonexposed Xylene-Were participants for distortion product otoacoustic Observed Emissions, adaptive test of temporal resolution, or the masking level difference test. A significant correlation Between the Concentrations of methyl hippuric acid in urine and pure-tone thresholds (2 to 8 kHz) was found in xylene-exposed workers. Also, participants With high cumulative dose of Xylene exposure test results presented With Poorer than low cumulative dose With participants of xylene exposure. Conclusions: The results of the present research is associated Suggest That Xylene With Central auditory adverse effects and Poorer sound detection abilities in humans. A major limitation of the study is That the results found Xylene-exposed Among participants can not be PROVED to be permanent, and THUS further research to clarify Should be Conducted esta limitation.

399;2999;Acoustic markers to differentiate gender in prepubescent children's speaking and singing voice;Objectives: Investigation Sought to determine Whether there is any acoustic Variable to objectively differentiate gender in Children with Normal voices. Methods: A total number of 30 children, 15 boys and 15 girls, with perceptually standard voices Examined Were. They Were Between 7 and 10 years old (mean: 8.1, SD: 0.7 years). Subjects Were required to perform the following phonatory tasks: (1) to phonate sustained vowels [a], [i], [u], (2) to read a phonetically balanced text, and (3) to sing a song . Acoustic analysis included long-term average spectrum (LTAS) fundamental frequency (F0), speaking critical frequency (SFF), equivalent continuous sound level (Leq), linear predictive code (LPC) to obtener formant frequencies, Measures perturbation, harmonic to noise ratio (HNR), and Cepstral peak Prominence (CPP). Auditory perceptual analysis was performed blinded by four Judges to determine gender. Results: No significant gender-related Differences Were found for MOST acoustic variables. Perceptual assessment Showed good intra- and inter rater reliability for gender. Cepstrum for [a], alpha ratio in text, shimmer for [i], F3 in [a], and F3 in [i:] Were the parameters That composed the multivariate logistic regression model to best differentiate male and female children's voices. Conclusion: Since perceptual assessment gender reliably detected, it is likely That other acoustic markers (Not Evaluated in the present study) are able to make clearer gender differences. For example, gender-specific patterns of intonation May be a more accurate feature for differentiating gender in children's voices. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY;2014;Artículo;Otorhinolaryngology;0;gender;acoust;children;perceptu;voic;children;177;0;0.0392635314995563;3;6;3;5;8;41

Vocal tract Semioccluded postures Have Been postulated to have a therapeutic effect During the treatment of the dysphonic patient. They Appear to Affect At least two components of the voice source (1) glottal flow press and (2) vibrational Characteristics of the Vocal Folds. Also vibrato Has Been Described as a possible therapeutic tool and may decrease phonatory hyperfunction. The aim of esta study was to determine the influence of resonance tubes and phonation With vibrato on the closed quotient. Thirty-six adult classical singers Were Recruited For This study. Subjects Were Asked to produce four phonatory tasks at comfortable pitch and loudness: sustained vowel [a] without vibrato, sustained vowel [a] With vibrato, sustained phonation into a straw without vibrato, and sustained phonation into a straw With vibrato. Computer analysis of the contact Quotient (CQ) was performed for each type of phonation in every participant. An Increase in CQ variability tube was Observed During phonation When Compared With phonation vowel. , Although there was a decrease in the mean values <U+200B><U+200B>When Comparing CQ vowel phonation without vibrato With the other three phonatory tasks, the difference was not statistically significant. Intrasubject analysis Demonstrated a decrease in the CQ During phonation tube and vibrato in MOST of the participants. , Although a causal relationship is not proven, This finding Suggests That the use of straws and vibrato During phonation May Have potential therapeutic value in the treatment of Patients With hyperfunctional voice disorders. © 2 The Voice Foundation.;JOURNAL OF VOICE;2013;Artículo;Otorhinolaryngology;0;phonat;vibrato;sustain;tube;voic;;0;0;0;3;6;3;5;8;41

Special emphasis was Given to the degree of anterior-posterior (A-P) laryngeal compression, compression laryngeal medial, vertical laryngeal position (VLP), and pharyngeal compression. Study Design Prospective study. Methods Twelve female singers trained at Least With 5 years of voice training and voice absence of any pathology Were included. Flexible and rigid laryngeal endoscopic examinations Were performed. Voice recording was Carried out Also. Blinded Four Judges Were Asked to ASSESS laryngoscopic and auditory perceptual variables using a visual analog scale. All results Showed significant laryngoscopic parameters for all singing styles Differences. Rock Showed the greatest degree for all of them. Overall A-P scores laryngeal compression Demonstrated Significantly higher values <U+200B><U+200B>than overall medial compression and VLP. High loudness level produced the highest degree of A-P compression, medial compression, pharyngeal compression, and the lowest VLP for all singing styles. Additionally, rock Demonstrated the highest values <U+200B><U+200B>for alpha ratio (less steep spectral slope), L1-L0 ratio (more glottal adduction), and Leq (more vowel intensity). Statistically significant Differences Between the three loudness levels for Were Also found These acoustic parameters. Conclusions Rock singing Seems to be the Style with the highest degree of laryngeal and pharyngeal Both activity in healthy singers. , Although, supraglottic activity During Could be labeled as singing hyperfunctional behavior vowel, it May Not Necessarily be harmful, but a strategy to avoid damage Vocal fold. © 2015 The Voice Foundation.;JOURNAL OF VOICE;2015;Artículo;Otorhinolaryngology;0;compress;laryng;sing;degre;rock;;0;0;0;3;6;3;5;8;41

Supporting cells can be induced to transdifferentiate into hair cells, but That would deplete Their numbers, THEREFORE impairing epithelium physiology. The loss of p27Kip1 function induces proliferation in the organ of Corti, Which raises the Possibility to integrate it to the Strategies to Achieve regeneration. NEVERTHELESS, it is not known if the extent of esta proliferative potential, as well as in postnatal stages ITS maintenance, is Compatible with providing a basis for eventual therapeutic manipulation. This is due in part to the limited success of Approaches to deliver tools to modify gene expression in the auditory epithelium. We tested the hypothesis organ of Corti That the significant proliferation can undergo efficient manipulation of the When expression of regulators of the cell cycle is Achieved.

403;3969;Effects of Electrical Stimulation of Olivocochlear Fibers in Cochlear Potentials in the Chinchilla;The mammalian cochlea has two types of sensory cells inner hair cells, Which receive afferent innervation auditory-nerve, and outer hair cells, innervated by efferent axons of the medial olivocochlear (MOC) system. The role of the MOC system is still controversial in hearing. Recently, by recording Cochlear potentials in Behaving chinchillas, we Suggested That one of the possible functions of the efferent system is to reduce sensitivity Cochlear attention to other sensory During Modalities (Delano et al in J Neurosci. 27: 4146-4153, 2007). However, in Spite of These compelling results, the physiological effects of electrical activation on Cochlear potentials MOC Have not Been Described in detail in chinchillas. The main objective of the present work was to describe These efferent effects in the chinchilla, Comparing them in other species Those With and in behavioral experiments. We activated the MOC efferent axons in chinchillas With middle-ear muscles sectioned by Applying current pulses at the fourth-floor ventricle. Auditory nerve compound action potentials-(CAP) and Cochlear microphonics (CM) Were acquired in response to clicks and tones of Several frequencies, using a round-window electrode. Electrical stimulation produced efferent CAP amplitude suppressions reaching up to 11 dB. They Were higher for low to moderate sound levels. Additionally, CM Increments amplitude Were found, the largest (= 2.5 dB) for low intensity tones. CAP suppression was present at all stimulus frequencies, but was greatest for 2 kHz. Were CM Increments highest for low-frequency tones, and almost absent at high frequencies. That the effect we close up commercial Obtained in chinchilla is similar to but smaller than That Observed in cats, and That the effects seen in awake chinchillas, albeit different in magnitude, are consistent With the activation of efferent fibers. © 2011 Association for Research in Otolaryngology.;JARO-JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR RESEARCH IN OTOLARYNGOLOGY;2011;Artículo;Otorhinolaryngology;0;chinchilla;effer;cochlear;frequenc;moc;;0;0;0;3;6;3;9;23;40

339;591;Mitochondrial dysfunction in Trypanosoma cruzi: the role of Serratia marcescens prodigiosin in the alternative treatment of Chagas disease;Background: Chagas disease is a health threat for many people, mostly Those living in Latin America. One of the Most Important problems in treatment is the limitation of Existing drugs. Prodigiosin, produced by Serratia marcescens (Rhodnius prolixus endosymbiont), belongs to the red-pigmented bacterial prodiginine family, Which displays biological activities Numerous, treats including antibacterial, antifungal, antiprotozoal, antimalarial, immunosuppressive, and anti-cancer properties. Here we describe ITS effects on mitochondria Trypanosoma cruzi Belonging to Tc and Tc I II. Results: Parasites prodigiosin exposed to altered mitochondrial function and the oxidative phosphorylation Could not have normal course, probably by inhibition of complex III. Prodigiosin did not produce cytotoxic effects in lymphocytes and Vero cells and have better effects than benznidazole. Our data Suggest That the action of prodigiosin on the parasites is mediated by mitochondrial structural and functional disruptions That Could Lead the parasites to an apoptotic-like cell death process. Conclusions: Here, we propose a trypanocidal agent derived from Potentially useful knowledge of an Important aspect of the nature of the parasite life cycle: the vector-parasite interaction. Our results Indicate That prodigiosin Could be a good candidate for the treatment of Chagas disease. © 2011 Genes et al licensee BioMed Central Ltd.;PARASITES & VECTORS;2011;Artículo;Parasitology;0;parasit;prodigiosin;belong;chaga;function;function;49;16;0.0108695652173913;6;4;17;4;5;8

During the congenital transmission parasite breaks down the placental barrier. In the present study we Analyzed the participation of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) in the extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling During ex vivo T. cruzi infection chorionic villi of human placental explants. Methods: Chorionic villi from healthy woman placentas Were incubated in the presence or absence of 105 or T. cruzi trypomastigotes 106 (Y strain) With or Without the MMPs inhibitor doxycycline. Effective parasite infection was tested measuring DNA by real-time PCR (qPCR). MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression by western blotting Were Determined and immunohistochemistry and Their activities Were Measured by zymography. The effect of MMPs on ECM structure was Analyzed histochemically. Results: T. cruzi induces the expression and activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in chorionic villi. Inhibition of the MMPs Prevents damage induced by the tissue T. cruzi and partially ex vivo Decreases the chorionic villi of the infection. Conclusion: MMPs are partially responsible for the ECM changes in human chorionic villi Observed During T. cruzi infection in tissue invasion and Participate. On the other hand, MMPs May be part of a placental Local antiparasitic mechanism. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

365;2321;Trypanosoma cruzi induces trophoblast differentiation: A potential local antiparasitic mechanism of the human placenta?;Introduction: The congenital transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) is responsible for one-third of new cases each year Chagas disease. During congenital transmission, the parasite breaks down the placental barrier FORMED by the trophoblast, villous stroma and basal laminae. The only 5% That observation of infected mothers transmit the parasite to the fetus IMPLIES That the placenta May impair parasite transmission. The trophoblast epithelial undergoes continuous turnover, Which is part of innate immunity Considered. THEREFORE, we propose T. cruzi That induces differentiation in the trophoblast as part of a local antiparasitic mechanism of the placenta. Methods: We ß Analyzed-human chorionic gonadotropin (ß-hCG) and syncytin protein expression in HPCVE and BeWo cells using immunofluorescence and western blotting. Additionally, b-hCG secretion into the culture medium by ELISA was Measured. We Assessed the differentiation of trophoblastic cells in BeWo cells using the two-colored fusion assay and by re-distribution Determining desmoplakin. Results: cruzi trypomastigotes induces ß T.-hCG secretion and protein expression as well as protein expression in syncyntin HPCVE and BeWo cells. Addionally, the parasite induces the fusion of trophoblast cells BeWo. Discussion: T. cruzi induces differentiation of the trophoblast, Which May Contribute to Increase the trophoblast turnover. The turnover Could be a component of antiparasitic Local Mechanisms in the human placenta. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

368;3185;Water-Soluble Ruthenium Complexes Bearing Activity Against Protozoan Parasites;Parasitic illnesses are major causes of human disease and misery worldwide. Among them, amebiasis and Chagas disease Both, Caused by the protozoan parasites, Entamoeba histolytica and Trypanosoma cruzi, are responsible for Thousands of annual deaths. The lack of safe and effective chemotherapy and / or the appearance of current drug resistance make the development of novel pharmacological treatment tools for Their Relevant. In This sense, the framework of the Within medicinal inorganic chemistry, metal-based drugs Appear to be a good alternative to find a pharmacological answer to parasitic diseases. In This work, novel ruthenium complexes [RuCl2 (HL) (HPTA) 2] Cl2 With HL = 5-nitrofuryl container containing bioactive thiosemicarbazones and PTA = 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane Have Been synthesized and fully Characterized. PTA was included as co-ligand in order to modulate complexes aqueous solubility. In fact, water soluble Were Obtained complexes. Their activity against T. cruzi and E. histolytica was EVALUATED in vitro. [RuCl2 (HL4) (HPTA) 2] Cl2 complex, with HL4 = N-phenyl-5-nitrofuryl-thiosemicarbazone, was the most active compound against Both parasites. In particularly, it Showed excellent activity against E. an histolytica (half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) = 5.2 uM), even higher than That of the reference drug metronidazole. In Addition, This complex turns out to be selective for E. histolytica (selectivity index (SI) & gt 38).

370;3254;Electrophysiological Characterization of Potassium Conductive Pathways in Trypanosoma cruzi;Potassium channels (K + channels) are members of one of the largest and MOST diverse families of membrane proteins, from bacteria to Widely Described humans. Their functions include voltage-membrane potential maintenance, pH and cell volume regulation, excitability, organogenesis and cell death. K + channels are Involved in Sensing and responsing to environmental changes: such as acidification, O2 pressure, osmolarity, and ionic concentration. Trypanosoma cruzi is a protozoan parasitic, disease causative agent of Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis) an endemic pathology in Latin America, up 200,000 new cases Where are Reported Annually. In protozoan parasites, the presence of K + channels Has Been Suggested, but direct evidence supporting esta functional hypothesis is limited, mainly due to the difficulty of conventional electrophysiological methods to Employing intact parasites. In T. cruzi, K + conductive pathways are thought to Contribute in the regulatory volume decrease Observed under hyposmotic stress, the steady state pH and the compensatory response to extracellular acidification and the maintenance of plasma membrane potential. In This work we describe the isolation of plasma membrane enriched fractions from T. cruzi epimastigotes, Their reconstitution into giant liposomes and the first functional characterization by patch-clamp of K + in protozoan parasites conductive pathways. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.;JOURNAL OF CELLULAR BIOCHEMISTRY;2011;Artículo;Parasitology;0;channel;membran;parasit;cruzi;function;function;49;16;0.0108695652173913;6;4;17;9;7;24

373;4007;Microsatellite loci-based distribution of Trypanosoma cruzi genotypes from Chilean chronic Chagas disease patients and Triatoma infestans is concordant with a specific host-parasite association hypothesis;The objective of esta study was to investigate if there is specific host-parasite association in Chilean Populations of Trypanosoma cruzi. For This purpose, two groups of parasites Were Analyzed, one from chronic chagasic Patients, and the other from triatomines Triatoma infestans in three regions of the country. The first group consisted of four types of samples: parasites from peripheral blood of non-cardiopathic T. cruzi infected Patients (NB) From their correspondiente xenodiagnosis parasites (NX) parasites from peripheral blood of T. cruzi infected cardiopathic Patients (CB) and parasites From their xenodiagnostics (CX). The T. infestans sample in turn was from three regions: III, V and M (Metropolitan). The genetic differentiation by the Fisher exact method, the lineage distribution of the samples, the molecular phylogeny and the frequency of multiclonality Were analysed. The results show not only are the That groups of T. cruzi clones from Chagas disease Patients and genetically Differentiated vectors, but all the Present sub-groups (NB, NX, CX and CB) from the III, V and M regions. The analysis of distribution lineage was concordant With the above results, Because significant Differences Among the Percentages of TCI, TcIII and hybrids (TCV or TCVI) Were Observed. The phylogenetic reconstruction With These Chilean T. cruzi samples was coherent With the above results Because the four chagasic samples clustered together in a high bootstrap support With node, Whereas the triatomine three samples (III, V and M) located apart from Were That node.

375;4295;Phylogenetic analysis of microsatellite markers further supports the two hybridization events hypothesis as the origin of the Trypanosoma cruzi lineages;To Better Understand the evolution of the etiologic agent of Chagas disease, we cloned and sequenced 25 alleles from five Trypanosoma cruzi microsatellite markers. The study of the highly conserved sequences Showed alleles present in T. cruzi clones Belonging to TCI, TCIIc, and TCIIe. This result was confirmed by the phylogenetic Also analysis of MCLE01 allele sequences. The examination by capillary electrophoresis of six microsatellite markers from 19 T. cruzi clones Showed a high proportion of the alleles found in the TCI Both TCII and sublineages. The phylogenetic reconstruction of These 19 clones produced a tree with two major clusters With 100% bootstrap support of and 95%. The first cluster includes T. cruzi clones Belonging to the TCI and TCIIa lineages. The second cluster is composed of TCI, TCIIc, TCIId, and TCIIe T. cruzi clones.

377;4323;Analysis of Toxoplasma gondii surface antigen 2 gene (SAG2). Relevance of genotype I in clinical toxoplasmosis;Toxoplasma gondii is one of the MOST successful protozoan parasites ITS ability to manipulate Given the immune system and Establish a chronic infection. It is a parasite with a significant impact on human health, mainly in immunocompromised patients. In Europe and North America, only a few clonal genotypes (I, II and III) seems to be responsible for the vast majority of Toxoplasma infections. Surface antigen 2 gene (SAG2) has-been extensively used for genotyping T. gondii isolates. The analysis reveals That de este locus in Northern hemisphere, human disease isolates are mainly Causing type II, isolated from T. gondii Whereas different animals are type II and III Both. Since the immune response depends on parasite genotype, it seems, Relevant to characterize human toxoplasmosis parasites producing in different geographical areas. The growing INFORMATION ABOUT THE T. gondii genotypes prevalent in South America mostly Refers to domestic animals. This is the first report of genetic characterization of T. gondii isolates from clinical samples in Chile, South America. All the samples corresponded to SAG2 Analyzed type I isolates, and They differ from classic SAG2 type I by genetic polymorphisms. This study Contributes to the scarce available information on T. gondii at South America, and reinforces an emerging concept suggesting SAG2 That type I, rather than II, parasites are a frequent cause of clinical toxoplasmosis in esta continent. © 2009 Springer Science + Business Media B.V.;MOLECULAR BIOLOGY REPORTS;2010;Artículo;Parasitology;0;gondii;isol;parasit;type;america;;0;0;0;12;6;12;4;5;8
378;4350;Expression, Functionality, and Localization of Apurinic/Apyrimidinic Endonucleases in Replicative and Non-Replicative Forms of Trypanosoma cruzi;Trypanosoma cruzi is the etiological agent of Chagas disease. The parasite has to Overcome oxidative damage by ROS / RNS ITS all along life cycle to survive and to Establish a chronic infection. We propose That T. cruzi is able to survive, Among other Mechanisms of detoxification, by repair of damaged DNA ITS through activation of the DNA repair based excision (BER) pathway. BER is highly conserved in eukaryotes With apurinic / apirimidinic endonucleases (APEs) playing a central role. Previous results Showed That T. cruzi exposed to hydrogen peroxide and peroxinitrite Significantly Decreases ITS viability When co-incubated With methoxyamine, an AP endonuclease inhibitor. This work in the localization, expression and functionality of two T. cruzi APEs (TcAP1, Homo sapiens APE1 orthologous and TcAP2, orthologous to Homo sapiens Schizosaccharomyces pombe APE2 and to Apn2p) Were determined. These enzymes are present and active in the two replicative parasite forms (Epimastigotes and amastigotes) as well as in the non-replicative, infective trypomastigotes. TcAP1 and TcAP2 are located in the nucleus of Epimastigotes and Their expression is constitutive. Epimastigote AP endonucleases as well as recombinant TcAP1 and TcAP2 are inhibited by methoxyamine. Overexpression of TcAP1 Epimastigotes viability Increases When They are exposed to acute ROS / RNS attack. This protective effect is more evident When parasites are submitted to persistent ROS / RNS exposition, mimicking nature conditions. Our results confirm the BER pathway That is Involved in T. cruzi resistance to oxidative DNA damage and points to the participation of DNA AP endonucleases in parasite survival. © 2 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.;JOURNAL OF CELLULAR BIOCHEMISTRY;2014;Artículo;Parasitology;0;tcap;cruzi;ape;dna;endonucleas;;0;0;0;6;4;17;8;5;7
379;4352;DNA Repair BER Pathway Inhibition Increases Cell Death Caused by Oxidative DNA Damage in Trypanosoma cruzi;Trypanosoma cruzi, a protozoan parasitic, is the etiological agent of Chagas disease, an endemic and neglected pathology in Latin America. It presents a life cycle That Involves a hematophagous insect and man as well as domestic and wild mammals. The parasitic infection is not eliminated by the immune system of mammals THUS, the vertebrate host serves as a reservoir parasite. Additionally, leading to chronic Processes dysfunction of the cardiac and digestive systems are Observed. To Establish a chronic infection Should some parasites resist the oxidative damage to DNA ITS exerted by oxygen and nitrogen free radicals (ROS / RNS) generated in host cells. Till date there are no reports showing oxidative DNA damage Directly and repair in T. cruzi. We Establish That ROS / RNS and kinetoplastid generate nuclear DNA damage in T. cruzi That May be partially repaired by the parasite. Furthermore, we determined to diminish That Both oxidative agents T. cruzi cell viability. This effect is augmented in Significantly subsequently incubated With methoxyamine parasites, DNA excision repair based (BER) pathway inhibitor, strongly suggesting That the T. cruzi maintenance of viability is a consequence of DNA repair Mechanisms.

The European rabbit is an introduced species in America, but ITS role as in the wild reservoir of Chagas disease transmission cycle remains unknown. We used polymerase chain reaction, Southern blotting, and hybridization tests to detect infection in rabbits and characterize genotypes from a hyperendemic area of <U+200B><U+200B>Chagas disease in Chile. Results show 38% of infection With different genotypes. We provide evidence That Rabbits are naturally infected T. cruzi With, Which May Have Important Consequences for Epidemiologic the wild transmission cycle.

382;4438;Chronic Chagas disease: PCR-xenodiagnosis without previous microscopic observation is a useful tool to detect viable Trypanosoma cruzi;We Evaluate the elimination of the microscopic stage of conventional xenodiagnosis (XD) to optimize the Parasitological diagnosis of Trypanosoma cruzi in chronic Chagas disease. To this purpose we applied under informed consent XD two cages 150 to chronic chagasic Chilean patients. The fecal samples (FS) of the triatomines at 30, 60 and 90 days post feeding divided into two parts Were: in one to search for mobile trypomastigote microscopic and / or epimastigote forms was performed. In the other part, DNA extraction for PCR-purification directed to the conserved region of kDNA minicircles of trypanosomes (XD-PCR), without previous microscopic observation was done. An XD was Considered positive At least one mobile When T. cruzi parasite in any one of three periods of incubation was Observed, Whereas PCR-XD was Considered positive 330 bp When the band specific for T. cruzi was detected. 25 of 26 cases With conventional positive XD XD Were PCR-positive (96.2% concordance), 85 of 124 cases Whereas With conventional negative positive by PCR Were XD-XD (68.5%). Human chromosome 12 detected by Real-time PCR used as internal monitoring of exogenous PCR-XD reaction allowed to discounting of PCR inhibition and false negative in 40 cases With negative PCR-XD. Conclusion: PCR-XD performed without previous microscopic observation is a useful tool for detection of parasites feasible With higher efficiency then a conventional XD.;BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH;2013;Artículo;Parasitology;0;pcr;posit;convent;microscop;cruzi;;0;0;0;6;4;17;4;5;8

333;607;Analysis of aberrant methylation on promoter sequences of tumor suppressor genes and total DNA in sputum samples: a promising tool for early detection of COPD and lung cancer in smokers;Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a disorder associated to cigarette smoke and lung cancer (LC). Since epigenetic changes in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes (TSG) are in the development Clearly Important of LC. In This study, we hypothesize are susceptible That tobacco smokers for methylation in the promoter region of TSG in airway epithelial cells When Compared With non-smoker subjects. The purpose of this study was to investigate the usefulness of detection of gene promoter methylation in sputum specimens, as a tool complementary to identify identity LC Among smokers With early biomarkers COPD.Methods: We determined to the amount of DNA in induced sputum from COPD Patients With ( n = 23), LC (n = 26), as well as in healthy subjects (CTR) (n = 33), using a commercial kit for DNA purification, followed by absorbance measurement at 260 nm. The frequency of CDKN2A, CDH1 and MGMT promoter methylation in the same groups was determined to by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP). The Fisher's exact test was employed to compare frequency of results Between different groups.Results: DNA concentration was 7.4 and 5.8 times higher in LC and COPD Compared to the (CTR) (p <0.0001), respectively. Methylation status of CDKN2A and MGMT was Significantly higher in COPD and LC Patients Compared With CTR group (p <0.0001). Frequency of CDH1 methylation Showed only statistically significant difference in LC Between Patients and CTR group (p <0.05) .Conclusions: We provide evidence That aberrant methylation of TSG in samples of induced sputum is a useful tool for early diagnosis of lung diseases (LC and COPD) in smoker subjects.Virtual slides: The abstract MUST finish With the following text: virtual Slides The virtual slide (s) for this article can be found here: http://www.diagnosticpathology.diagnomx.eu/vs/1127865005664160. © 2012 Guzman et al . licensee BioMed Central Ltd.;DIAGNOSTIC PATHOLOGY;2012;Artículo;Pathology;0;methyl;copd;compar;ctr;smoker;;0;0;0;12;6;12;6;9;7

335;2042;Reduced Cystathionine gamma-Lyase and Increased miR-21 Expression Are Associated with Increased Vascular Resistance in Growth-Restricted Pregnancies Hydrogen Sulfide as a Placental Vasodilator;Increased vascular impedance in the fetoplacental circulation is associated With fetal growth restriction and hypoxia. We Sought to investigate the role of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in regulating vasomotor tone in the fetoplacental vasculature. H2S is produced endogenously by cystathionine ß catalytic activity of cystathionine <U+03B3>-synthase and-lyase (CSE). Immunohistochemical analysis CSE localized to smooth muscle cells in arteries encircling stem villi. Immunoreactivity was reduced in placentas from severe early pregnancies With growth-restriction-onset preeclampsia and displaying abnormal umbilical artery Doppler waveforms preeclamptic placentas Compared With Normal With waveforms and controls. These findings Were confirmed at the protein and mRNA levels. MicroRNA-21, Which Regulates negatively CSE expression, was in placentas With Increased abnormal Doppler waveforms. Exposure of villus explants to hypoxia-reoxygenation Significantly reduced CSE protein and mRNA and microRNA-21 Increased expression. No changes in cystathionine ß Were Observed-synthase expression, immunolocalized Principally to the trophoblast, in pathologic placentas or in vitro. Finally, perfusion of the normal placentas With an H2S donor, after thromboxane mimetic with a preconstriction, Resulted in dose-dependent vasorelaxation. Glibenclamide and -nitro-L-arginine methyl ester partially blocked the effect, indicating That H2S acts through ATP-sensitive K + channels and nitric oxide synthesis. These results Demonstrate That H2S is a powerful vasodilator of the placental vasculature and that expression of CSE is reduced in placentas Associated With Increased vascular resistance.

336;2044;Attenuation of endoplasmic reticulum stress using the chemical chaperone 4-phenylbutyric acid prevents cardiac fibrosis induced by isoproterenol;Increasing evidence Indicates That endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is Involved in various diseases. In the human heart, ischemia / reperfusion has-been correlated to ER stress, and Several markers of the unfolded protein response (UPR) Participate During cardiac remodeling and fibrosis. Here, we used isoproterenol (ISO) as a model for injection in vivo cardiac fibrosis. ISO cardiomyocyte induced significant loss and collagen deposition in the damaged areas of the endocardium. These responses Were Accompanied by an Increase in the protein levels of the luminal ER chaperones BIP and PDI, as well as an Increase in the UPR effector CHOP. The use of the chemical chaperone 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA) preventer the activation of the UPR, the Increase in luminal chaperones and also, leads to collagen deposition Decreased, cardiomyocyte loss into the damaged zones. Our results Suggest That cardiac damage and fibrosis induced in vivo by the beta-adrenergic agonist ISO are tightly related to ER stress signaling pathways, and That increase increasing the ER luminal folding capacity With exogenously administrated 4-PBA is a powerful strategy for preventative the development of cardiac fibrosis. Additionally, 4-PBA Might Prevent the loss of cardiomyocytes. Our data Suggests That the attenuation of ER stress pathways With pharmacological compounds: such as the chemical chaperone 4-PBA can Prevent the development of cardiac fibrosis and adverse remodeling. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.;EXPERIMENTAL AND MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY;2012;Artículo;Pathology;0;cardiac;fibrosi;chaperon;pba;prevent;;0;0;0;5;5;5;8;11;10
337;2302;Higher blood vessel density in comparison to the lymphatic vessels in oral squamous cell carcinoma;Introduction: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the local Characterized by invasion and the development of cervical metastasis. In the tongue, an association Between the invasion of the lymphatic vessels and the development of metastasis in the regional lymph nodes Has Been Demonstrated. , Moreover, invasion of the blood vessels is associated With Poorer prognoses and greater recurrence. THEREFORE, the presence and density of lymphatic and blood vessels in intra-and peritumoral tissues play an Important Role Should in the progression, dissemination and metastasis of carcinomas. However, the evidence is inconclusive Regarding OSCC. The aim of esta study was to determine the comparison and association Between the lymphatic (D2-40) and blood vessel (CD34) in intratumoral OSCC tissue densities. Materials and Methods: Thirty-seven cases diagnosed as OSCC Between the years 2000 and 2008 Were Obtained from the Anatomic Pathology Service of the School of Dentistry, University of Chile. The immunohistochemical markers D2-40 and CD34 Were used, and the densities (mm (2)) of lymphatic vessels (LVD) and blood vessels (BVD) in the intratumoral region Were determined. The Relationship Between LVD and BVD was EVALUATED values. Results: There Were significant association Between the D2-40 and CD34 expression (rho = 0.4, P <0.05) and Between the LVD and the location in the tongue (P = 0.019). The BVD was greater (128.0 vessels / mm (2)) than the LVD (42.9 vessels / mm (2)), and there was a positive correlation Between the LVD and BVD. Conclusions: In OSCC, the BVD is greater than the LVD, and there is a moderate correlation Between the two quantities.;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL PATHOLOGY;2015;Artículo;Pathology;0;vessel;lvd;bvd;oscc;blood;blood;61;11;0.0135314995563443;12;6;12;6;25;7
338;2559;Merkel cell polyomavirus in non-small cell lung carcinomas from Chile;Lung cancer is a leading pathology strongly associated With the smoking habit. However, a viral etiology for a subset of developing lung cancer Patients Has Been Suggested. Polyomaviruses (PyVs) are small double stranded DNA viruses associated With the development of some human diseases. However, a causal role of viruses in human cancer These has-been difficult to Demonstrate. In This study, eighty-six non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs) adenocarcinomas Including (ADCs) and squamous cell lung carcinomas (SQCS) from Chile Were Analyzed for the presence of PyVs using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All of the specimens Were positive for a gene fragment of the betaglobin. We found That 4/86 (4.7%) of lung carcinomas Were positive for PyVs. After sequencing and BlastN alignment, all four cases Were Identified as polyomaviruses Merkel cell (MCV) That corresponded to two ADCs and two SQCS. A non-significant statistical association was found Between the Presence of MCV and clinic-pathological features of the Patients and tumors. In Addition, 1/4 (25%) of the carcinomas expressing large T Were Actively antigen (LT) transcripts, as Demonstrated by reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). THUS a possible role of MCV in a very small subset of Patients With Lung cancer can not be ruled out and warrants more investigation. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.;EXPERIMENTAL AND MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY;2012;Artículo;Pathology;0;lung;cancer;carcinoma;mcv;pcr;cancer;120;4;0.0266193433895297;1;8;7;2;6;27
310;456;Lactulose Hydrogen Breath Test and Functional Symptoms in Pediatric Patients;Background The role of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) in functional digestive disorders in the pediatric population is a matter of controversy, since methods used to Establish esta Currently diagnosis are difficult to interpret. The aim of This work was to analyze the Characteristics of the lactulose H2 breath test (LHBT) in Children with functional gastrointestinal symptoms to more recent criteria ACCORDING. Methods Seventy-two Patients and controls 17 Were enrolled. A questionnaire was administered Regarding digestive symptoms (abdominal pain, bloating, vomiting, and bowel-movement disorders). A breath test was lactose hydrogen performed to rule out lactose malabsorption and to LHBT was used to measure the time elapsed Between lactulose oral ingestion and an increment of H 2 concentration of 20 ppm over basal. Results There Were not of age and gender Differences Between Patients and controls. Mean time to change 20-ppm was shorter in Patients (56.3 ± 3 min) Compared to healthy children (74.7 ± 5 min), p & lt 0.05. In 39% of Patients, rise of H 2 occurred During The first 40 min after lactulose ingestion, and in almost all controls, an increment was Observed Between 50 and 90 min (p & lt 0.05). Were symptoms unrelated to time to change 20-ppm. Conclusions An abnormal LHBT was found in Children with functional symptoms of the digestive tract, but the exact mechanism Involved, accelerated intestinal transit or SIBO, needs to be confirmed by an additional method. © 2012 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.;DIGESTIVE DISEASES AND SCIENCES;2012;Artículo;Pediatrics;0;min;symptom;children;digest;function;children;177;0;0.0392635314995563;8;8;12;2;24;14
311;495;Expression of SOCS1, SOCS2, and SOCS3 in growth hormone-stimulated skin fibroblasts from children with idiopathic short stature;Background / aim: Possible etiologies of idiopathic short stature (ISS) include a range of conditions, some of Which May be Caused by defects in the modulation of the growth hormone (GH) -signaling pathway. The Janus kinase / signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway is regulated by Several Mechanisms, Including negative feedback regulation by the suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS). However, the specific induction of SOCS transcript levels in fibroblasts from ISS Patients Has not Been Studied. Methods: We determined to the transcript levels of the genes under basal conditions SOCS1-3, and in the presence or absence of stimulation for 24 h rhGH With in skin fibroblast cultures from Patients With Obtained ISS and children With Normal height. Results: Under basal conditions, ISS Patients express higher levels than Control SOCS2-3 transcript children. After incubation With recombinant human GH (rhGH), the transcript levels of SOCS2 Increased Significantly in ISS Patients Compared to controls (0.79 ± 0.06 vs. 0.55 ± 0.07 p = 0.03), a pattern did not Which Achieve statistical significance for SOCS3 transcript levels (0.55 ± 0.08 vs. 0.40 ± 0.07). Conclusion: The higher baseline transcript levels of the SOCS genes, and the Increase Observed for SOCS2 after rhGH treatment in ISS Patients, SUGGEST That growth retardation in some of These children May be mediated, at Least in part, by intracellular overexpression of the SOCS genes . © 2012 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin Boston.;JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM;2012;Artículo;Pediatrics;0;soc;transcript;iss;children;condit;children;177;0;0.0392635314995563;12;6;12;8;16;12
312;594;Latin American Consensus: Children Born Small for Gestational Age;Background: Children born small for gestational age (SGA) experience higher rates of mortality and morbidity than Appropriate for gestational Those born age. In Latin America, identification and optimal management of children born SGA is a critical issue. Leading experts in pediatric endocrinology Throughout Latin America working groups established in order to discuss key challenges Regarding the evaluation and management of children born SGA and Ultimately Develop a consensus statement.Discussion: SGA is defined as a birth weight and / or birth length greater than 2 standard deviations (SD) below the mean for gestational reference population age. SGA Refers to body size and length-weight IMPLIES reference data in a geographical population Whose ethnicity is Known and specific to this group. Ideally, each country / region Within Latin America Should Establish Its Own Relevant standards and make updates. SGA EVALUATED With Children Should be standardized by trained personnel Measures every 3 months During year 1 and every 6 months During year 2. Those without catch-up growth Within the first 6 months of life need further evaluation, as do children Whose weight is = - 2 SD at age 2 years. Growth hormone treatment can begin in SGA children> 2 Years with short stature (<-2.0 SD) and to growth velocity <25th percentile for Their age, and height Should continue Until end (a growth velocity below 2 cm / year or to bone age of> 14 years for girls and> 16 years for boys) is reached. Blood glucose, thyroid function, HbA1c, and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) Should be Monitored eleven year. Monitoring changes from baseline insulin and surrogates of insulin sensitivity is essential. Reduced fetal growth followed by excessive postnatal catch-up in height, and weight in Particularly, Should be closely Monitored. In Both sexes, gonadal function Should be Monitored especially During puberty.Summary: Children born SGA Carefully Should be followed by a multidisciplinary group perinatologists That includes, pediatricians, nutritionists, and pediatric endocrinologists since 10% to 15% will continue to Have weight and height deficiency through development and may benefit from growth hormone treatment. Standards / Guidelines Should be developed on a country / region basis Throughout Latin America. © 2011 Boguszewski et al licensee BioMed Central Ltd.;BMC PEDIATRICS;2011;Artículo;Pediatrics;0;sga;children;growth;age;born;children;177;0;0.0392635314995563;10;3;10;3;15;45
313;928;Differences in Body Composition and Resting Energy Expenditure in Childhood in Preterm Children Born with Very Low Birth Weight;Background: Rapid early growth weight is associated adverse metabolic With Risks in young adults born at term. Aim: To determine Whether there are Differences in body composition, resting energy expenditure (REE) and metabolic variables Between preterm children born with very low birth weight (VLBW) Either Appropriate (AGA) or small (SGA) for gestational age and Whether These Differences are related to an early period of weight gain. Methods: 67 VLBW preterm (40 AGA, 27 SGA). By DEXA body composition, REE by indirect calorimetry and blood sampling at age 6.7 ± 0.5 years. Results: SGA VLBW children Were lighter, shorter, had a lower waist and hip circumference, HDL cholesterol and lipid oxidation rates than AGA Their Counterparts (adjusted for age, sex and BMI). Birth weight correlated negatively With Total body fat mass and trunk. In a multivariate linear regression analysis, we found a positive association Between weight gain in the first 3 months of life and overall and trunk fat at age 6 years and a reciprocal association with REE at age 6 years. In contrast, the weight gain rate at 6-9 months of life was associated With REE and higher lipid oxidation rates at 6 years. A higher weight gain rate at 9-12 months was associated with a higher lean mass at 6 years. Conclusion: An early fast-pace weight gain in VLBW infants May Have Consequences detrimental for metabolic health later on. Copyright © 2 S.

314;941;A phase 2, randomized, double-blind safety and pharmacokinetic assessment of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) prophylaxis with motavizumab and palivizumab administered in the same season;Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an annual Causing Important pathogen epidemics of bronchiolitis and pneumonia Among infants worldwide. High-risk infants receive RSV prophylaxis Currently With palivizumab, a humanized RSV monoclonal antibody (MAb). In preclinical in vitro and in vivo (rat model cotton-) studies, motavizumab, a new RSV MAb, was shown To have greater anti-RSV activity than palivizumab. Currently under review is motavizumab for licensing approval. Both MAbs Since May be available concurrently, This study safety and tolerability Their EVALUATED When administered sequentially During the same RSV season.Methods: Between April 2006 and May 2006, 260 high-risk infants randomly Were Assigned 1: 1: 1 to receive monthly intramuscular injections: 2 doses of motavizumab followed by three doses of palivizumab (M / P) 2 doses of palivizumab followed by three doses of motavizumab (P / M) or 5 doses of motavizumab (control). Adverse events (AEs, AEs serious [SAEs]), development of antidrug antibody (ADA), and serum drug Trough Concentrations Were assessed.Results: Most children received all 5 doses (246/260 [94.6%]) and completed the study ( 241/260 [92.7%]). While overall AE rates Were like (mostly level 1 or 2 in severity), SAEs and level 3 AEs occurred more Frequently in the M / P group (SAEs: 22.9% M / P, 8.4% P / M 11.8% motavizumab only level 3 AEs: 15.7% M / P, 6.0% P / M, 6.5% motavizumab only). This trend occurred in AE rates before and after switching from motavizumab to palivizumab, suggesting a cause other than the combined regimen. Frequencies of AEs Judged by the investigator to be related to study drug Were Among groups like. Two deaths occurred on study (both in the M / P group, palivizumab before administration) neither was Considered by the site investigator to be related to study drug. Mean serum trough drug Concentrations Were comparable Among groups ADA detection was infrequent (5.1% or less of any group) .Conclusions: The conclusions drawn From this study are limited by the small sample size per group. However, Within This small study, overall AE rates, serum drug Trough Concentrations, and development of ADA Associated With Administering motavizumab and palivizumab sequentially to high-risk children comparable to Appear During Administering motavizumab alone the same RSV season. © 2 Fernández et al licensee BioMed Central Ltd.;BMC PEDIATRICS;2010;Artículo;Pediatrics;0;motavizumab;palivizumab;rsv;dose;drug;;0;0;0;9;8;9;10;14;10

We Measured markers of inflammation (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 8 and tumor necrosis a factor), endothelial damage (Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 metalloproteinase-9, and metalloproteinase-2), and oxidative stress (malondialdehyde). Data Were Expressed as median and interquartile range (IQR) .results: We found Differences in polymorphism rs836478 (intron 3 C & gt T) in Both genotypic (<U+03C7>2 = 15.02, 2df P = 0.0005) and allelic (X2 = 5.5, 1df  P = 0.01) vs. frequencies in NH NN subjects. NH subjects with a TT genotype Showed Increase MMP9 expression (median = 2.3, IQR 1.6-3.2-, vs. median = 1.6, IQR = 1.6-2.3 AU P = 0.01) and lower IL-6 expression (median = 8.8, IQR = 7.0-11.8 vs. median = 12.1, IQR = 8.2-14.7 pg / ml P = 0.02) Compared With subjects With TC / CC genotype. No difference in the allelic frequency distribution was seen in the rs10951982 polymorphism (NH vs. NN: <U+03C7>2 = 0.2, 1df P = 0.6). For This SNP, NN subjects With GA / AA genotype Showed Decreased BP diastolic indexes Compared With GG genotype subjects With native (median = 1.08, IQR = 1.0-1.2 vs. median = 0.99, IQR = 0.94-1.1 P = 0.02) .Conclusions: We report the frequency of rs836478 and rs10951982 polymorphisms of the RAC1 gene in a Spanish-Amerindian Cohort.

318;1368;Comparative analysis of clinical, biochemical and genetic aspects associated with bone mineral density in small for gestational age children;Clinical, biochemical and genetic analysis related to bone mineral density (BMD) Were Carried out in children born small for gestational age (SGA) that failed to Achieve postnatal catch-up growth (CUG), SGA children That completed CUG and adequate for gestational age (AGA) children. Serum IGF-I, IGF-II, IGF binding protein-3 and acid-labile subunit Were lower in the SGA-CUG children as Compared With the other groups. Frequencies of polymorphic variants of vitamin D receptor, estrogen receptor and collagen genes Were Among like groups. The Genotype 194-192 of the IGF-I gene was higher in the SGA-CUG and 196-192 was higher in the SGA + CUG group. In the SGA-CUG group, the SS genotype of the gene was associated COLIA1 With lower BMD. THEREFORE, IGF system and COLIA1 polymorphism distinguish prepubertal children SGA-CUG CUG from the SGA + children of the same age. Furthermore, Could be useful COLIA1 polymorphism to predict osteopenia in SGA-CUG children. © 2011 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin Boston.;JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM;2011;Artículo;Pediatrics;0;cug;sga;children;igf;age;children;177;0;0.0392635314995563;10;3;10;3;15;30
319;2277;Long-term neuroendocrine effects of iron-deficiency anemia in infancy;Introduction: Iron deficiency anemia-(IDA) is Recognized To have long-lasting effects on neurodevelopment, but there is little research on neuroendocrine systems. Methods: This study Examined the effects of IDA in early infancy or later on plasma cortisol and prolactin stress-response patterns for 1 h after venipuncture and to catheter placement in 10-y-old healthy children Chilean. Children Identified With IDA at 6 m (IDA-6 n = 13) or 12 m (IDA-12 n = 24) and WHO Were iron sufficient (IS) at other infancy time points Were Compared to children WHO were is at all During time points infancy (n = 23). All children received at Least 6 m of oral iron treatment in infancy. Results: At age 10 and of IDA and IDA-6-12 Demonstrated children altered cortisol response patterns Both Showed a more immediate decline and IDA-12 children Showed a blunted curvature as Compared to IS children. IDA-12 children Showed Significantly lower cortisol levels at 30 and 45 min after venipuncture and catheter placement than did children IS.

320;2723;Family-Based Association Study Between SLC2A1, HK1, and LEPR Polymorphisms With Myelomeningocele in Chile;Obese / diabetic mothers present to higher risk to Develop offspring With myelomeningocele (MM), evidence supporting the role of energy homeostasis-related genes in neural tube defects. Using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism, We Have genotyped SLC2A1, HK1, and LEPR single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 105 Chilean Patients With MM and Their parents in order to evaluate- allele-phenotype associations by Means of allele / haplotype transmission test (TDT ) and parent-of-origin effects. We detected an undertransmission for the SLC2A1 haplotype T-A (rs710218-rs2229682, P = 0.040), Which was not significant When only lower MM (90% of the cases) was Analyzed. In Addition, the leptin receptor rs1137100 G allele Showed a significant Increase in the risk of maternal alleles for MM-derived in the whole sample (2.43-fold P = 0.038) and in lower MM (3.20-fold P = 0.014 ). Our results support the role of genes in energy homeostasis in Involved the risk of developing MM, just thus sustaining the hypothesis of diverse pathways and genetic Mechanisms acting in the expression of birth defect Such. © The Author (s) 2.;REPRODUCTIVE SCIENCES;2013;Artículo;Pediatrics;0;allel;risk;defect;develop;energi;develop;57;13;0.0126441881100266;12;6;19;4;20;29
321;2887;Higher Infant Blood Lead Levels with Longer Duration of Breastfeeding;Objective: To determine Whether longer breastfeeding is associated With Lead Concentrations higher infant. Study design: Data Were Analyzed from three studies of developmental effects of iron deficiency in infancy: Costa Rica (1981-1984), Chile (1991-1996), and Detroit (2002-2003). The relation Between Duration of breastfeeding and lead levels was Assessed With Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients or partial. Results: More than 93% of the Costa Rica and Chile samples was breastfed (breastfed infants 179 and 323, respectively mean age weaning, 8-10 months) was 35.6% as of the Detroit sample (53 breastfed infants mean age weaning , 4.5 months). Lead Concentrations Averaged 10.8 mg / dL (Costa Rica, 12-23 months), 7.8 mg / dL (Chile, 12 months), and 2.5 mg / dL (Detroit 9-10 months). Duration of breastfeeding as sole source milk and breastfeeding Total lead concentration in correlated With all samples (r = 0.14 to 0.57 values P = .06 values <U+200B><U+200B>- <0001.). Conclusions: Longer breastfeeding was associated With higher lead concentration in infant 3 country clubs, in 3 different Decades, in settings differing in breastfeeding patterns, environmental lead sources, and infant lead levels.

322;2890;Randomized Trial of Early Bubble Continuous Positive Airway Pressure for Very Low Birth Weight Infants;Objective: To determine Whether very low birth weight infants (VLBWIs), initially supported With continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and then a selectively Treated With the INSURE (intubation, surfactant, and extubation to CPAP, CPAP / INSURE) protocol, need less mechanical Those supported ventilation than With supplemental oxygen, surfactant, and mechanical ventilation if required (Oxygen / mechanical ventilation [MV]). Study design: In a multicenter randomized controlled trial, spontaneously breathing VLBWIs weighing 800-1500 g Were Allocated to receive Either therapy. In the CPAP / INSURE group, if respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) did not Occur, CPAP was discontinued after 6.3 hours. If RDS developed and the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2) was & gt 0.35, the protocol was INSURE Indicated. Failure criteria included FiO 2 & gt .60, severe apnea or respiratory acidosis, and receipt of more than 2 doses of surfactant. In the Oxygen / MV group, in the presence of RDS, supplemental oxygen without CPAP was Given, and if FiO 2 was & gt 0.35, surfactant and mechanical ventilation Were provided. Results: A total number of 256 Patients randomized to Were Either the CPAP / INSURE group (n = 131) or the Oxygen / MV group (n = 125). The need for mechanical ventilation was lower in the CPAP / INSURE group (29.8% vs 50.4% P = .001), as was the use of surfactant (27.5% vs 46.4% P = .002). There Were no Differences in death, pneumothorax, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and other complications of prematurity Between the two groups. Conclusion: CPAP and early selective INSURE reduced the need for mechanical ventilation and surfactant in VLBWIs morbidity and death without increase increasing.

324;2934;Acardiac fetus complicating a triplet pregnancy: management and outcome;Objective: To report our Experience with the management of triplet pregnancies complicated by an acardiac fetus. Methods: During the five-year period from 2003 to 2008, five cases Were identified. The prenatal sonographic findings, antepartum course, if antenatal intervention performed, and perinatal outcome of each case Were reviewed. Results: Were Four pregnancies spontaneously and one was conceived by in vitro fertilization Achieved. Three pregnancies Were Were dichorionic and two monochorionic, and two fetuses Were acardiac part of a monoamniotic set. All cases underwent an early sonographic examination, but the diagnosis was only made in the first trimester in only two cases, as the acardiac fetus was overlooked or inaccurately Identified as a dead fetus in the remaining three cases. Early fetal demise before 12 weeks occurred in a case of monochorionic-triamniotic triplets. Percutaneous laser coagulation of the main intraabdominal vessel was attempted at 17 weeks in two cases, with subsequent delivery after 34 weeks and perinatal survival of three of the four structurally regular fetuses. In the other two pregnancies managed expectantly Which Were, complicated by severe Were Both preterm delivery With perinatal survival of three of the four structurally regular fetuses. Overall, There Were No Survivors in one case, one twin survived in two cases, and two twins survived in the remaining two cases. None of the survivor HAD neurological sequelae. Conclusions: The presence of an acardiac fetus in a triplet pregnancy Carries a high risk for poor pregnancy outcome, fetal death and severe Including preterm labor. Prenatal intervention Indicated May be in some cases, but does not Prevent fetal death of the pump twin.

325;3023;Acquired cholesteatoma in children following congenital cholesteatoma surgery;Objectives: To determine the incidence of severe atelectatic otitis media and cholesteatoma acquired (AC) in Children Treated for congenital cholesteatoma (CC). Methods: Retrospective chart review of 15 children underwent primary surgery for WHO CC over a 15 year period by a single surgeon. Results: The mean postoperative follow up was 3.1 years. Significant tympanic retraction occurred in six children, included a retraction pocket That required T-tube insertion (3), and AC Requiring tympanomastoid surgery (3). There was no complication related to retraction pocket in nine children however two residual developed disease. In Comparing the two groups, and without subsequent Those With significant tympanic retraction, Both groups ADH like gender, age, extent of CC (median Potsic grade of 2), bone erosion, and surgical technique. Differences Were NOTED in air-bone gap at presentation (PTA 32.4 and 17.25), otitis media with effusion in the contralateral ear (3/6 and 1/9), smaller ear mastoid volume ratio Compared With the contralateral (0.74 and 1.21), and longer average timing for second surgery (14.8 months and 8 months). Conclusions: Acquired middle ear disease, Including cholesteatoma, surgical removal of can follow CC, and long term follow up of all Patients is required. Factors at initial evaluation indicative of risk of AC include a significant air-bone gap, otitis media with effusion in the contralateral ear and mastoid cavity to smaller ratio. The use of composite grafts at the time of CC surgery Should be considered.

327;3281;Aldosterone, Plasma Renin Activity, and Aldosterone/Renin Ratio in a Normotensive Healthy Pediatric Population;Primary aldosteronism is an Important cause of secondary hypertension and is suspected in Adults with an aldosterone / renin ratio =25. The Normal aldosterone / renin ratio in children is unknown. The aim was to Establish serum aldosterone, plasma renin activity, and aldosterone / renin ratio values <U+200B><U+200B>in a healthy pediatric population. A cross-sectional study was performed in 211 healthy children normotensive (4 to 16 years old). Two Subgroups of normotensive children Were Obtained: with hypertensive parents (NH) (n = 113) and normotensive parents (n = 98). Blood samples for measuring serum aldosterone, plasma renin activity, aldosterone / renin ratio, and DNA Were Collected. In subjects With aldosterone / renin ratio =25, the chimeric CYP11B1 / CYP11B2 gene was Investigated by long-extension PCR. Results are Expressed as median [Q 1 Q-3]. NH and normotensive parents groups Were like in serum aldosterone (6.5 [3.6 to 9.0] ng / dL versus 6.5 [2.9 to 9.7] ng / dL P = 0.968) and plasma renin activity (2.3 [1.6 to 3.1] versus 2.4 [1.7 to 3.7] ng / mL per hour P = 0.129). The aldosterone / renin ratio was higher in the NH group, but did not reach esta difference statistical significance (2.8 [1.9 to 4.1] versus 2.5 [1.4 to 4.0], P = 0.104). In one subject of the NH group, the chimeric CYP11B1 / CYP11B2 gene was detected.

328;3324;Outcome of tunnelled central venous catheters used for haemodialysis in children weighing less than 15 kg;Central venous catheters Purpose (CVC) are used for hemodialysis Frequently (HD) in children. However, there is paucity of information on the outcomes of CVCs When used for HD in very young patients. Our objective is to report the success, safety and complication rates of CVCs used for HD in children weighing less than 15 kg. Materials and methods This is a single-center retrospective study of all Patients With End-stage renal disease (ESRD) weighing <15kg, underwent a tunneled CVC WHO placement for HD, Between July 2006 and June 2012 at our institution. Analysed data included clinical background, age and weight at initiation of HD, HD outcome of CVC insertion site vein, reason for removal, and catheter survival (in days). Results Thirty-one Were CVC Placed in 11 Patients weighing <15 kg, 8 males and 3 females. The main causes of ESRD renal dysplasia and congenital Were nephrotic syndrome. At the beginning of HD, mean age was 27.5 (range 5-60) months and mean weight was 10.4 kg (4.5-13 kg). The preferred insertion site was the right internal jugular vein (90%). Mean duration of HD was 312 days. Mechanical factors Were the main reason for catheter removal (39%). Mean survival was 110 days catheter / catheter. Conclusions We believe our study Provides Relevant information and data to support encouraging the use of CVC for HD In This cohort of infants however, further improvement in prevention of catheter thrombosis and management of infections needs to be Achieved. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.;JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC SURGERY;2014;Artículo;Pediatrics;0;cathet;cvc;mean;weigh;age;age;151;2;0.0334960070984916;9;8;9;5;22;34
329;3342;Polymorphisms of MAMLD1 gene in hypospadias;Purpose: Mastermind-like domain containing 1 (MAMLD1) is a causative gene for the fetal development of male external genitalia. Almost 10% of Patients With Both severe and non-severe hypospadias exhibit mutations of MAMLD1. The aim of This work was to determine Whether polymorphisms of MAMLD1 are a genetic risk factor for hypospadias. Material and Methods: This study included 150 hypospadias with a range of severities and 150 controls. Direct sequencing of the MAMLD1 coding exons and flanking splice sites Their was performed. In silico prediction secondary and tertiary structure and accessibility of amino acids changed Were EVALUATED using JPred, Netsurf and PHYRE software. Functional studies of the transactivation of haplotypes on Hes3 promoter in vitro Were performed using cDNAs of missense variants of MAMLD1. Results: The p.P286S polymorphism was Identified in 17/150 12/150 Patients and controls (11.3% vs. 8.0%, p = 0.32). The p.N589S <U+200B><U+200B>polymorphism was Identified in 22/150 12/150 Patients and controls (14.6% vs. 8.0%, p = 0.068). The double polymorphism (S-S haplotype) was present in 6/150 16/150 Patients and controls (10.6% vs. 4.0%, p = 0.044, OR = 2.87, CI 1.09 to 7.55 from). The association of polymorphisms consistently revealed a modification in the amino acid structure prediction or accessibility in all three in silico models. The P286S, P286S + N589S <U+200B><U+200B>N589S <U+200B><U+200B>and did not exhibit reduced proteins transactivating activity on Hes3 promoter. Conclusion: Polymorphisms of MAMLD1 gene are frequent in Patients With hypospadias. , Although no change in transactivation was NOTED on Hes3 promoter, the in silico studies and the incidence of the Significantly Increased S-S haplotype in hypospadiac Patients raise the hypothesis of susceptibility conferred by owners These variants. © 2 Journal of Pediatric Urology Company.

331;3638;Differences in Body Composition and Energy Expenditure in Prepubertal Children Born Term or Preterm Appropriate or Small for Gestational Age;Small size at birth May result from fetal May Occur Which undernutrition at different times During gestation. Early postnatal catch-up growth and excess weight gain are associated childhood With An Increased risk of adult cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The aim of study was to esta ASSESS the relative contributions Issue of body composition and energy expenditure on fasting insulin sensitivity During late childhood. We Took advantage of two prospective cohorts of Previously Described children born at term or prematurely Either, with a wide range of birth weights adjusted for gestational age. Seventy-one prepubertal children (mean age 7.5 ± 0.3 years) Were Examined: 23 term SGA (8 M, 15 F), 12 preterm SGA (7 M, 5 F), 16 term AGA (8 M, 8 F), and 20 preterm AGA (9 M, 11 F). Mean height SDS was -0.18 ± 0.11 and mean BMI SDS was 0.27 ± 0.03. Change in weight SDS was higher in children Significantly-born SGA Compared To Their AGA Counterparts (p <0.001). Change in weight SDS was highly correlated With fasting insulin (p <0.03) and leptin (p <0.001). Only with insulin fasting serum leptin correlated levels. Body composition Appeared to be the main determinant of fasting leptin levels. No Differences in lipid profile Were Observed Between the different groups. There was a clear tendency to higher insulin and leptin levels in children born SGA AGA Compared With Their Counterparts. IGF-I levels Were Significantly higher only in SGA term AGA Compared to term. Resting energy expenditure (REE) was lower in SGA born at term and higher in SGA born preterm AGA Compared to Their Counterparts. In conclusion, is mainly fasting insulin sensitivity Determined by leptin levels in turn are determined to Which by body composition. IGF-I and REE Showed a divergent pattern in SGA term Compared To SGA preterm groups. IGF-I levels Were Determined only by weight change from birth to age 2 years, Which May not be as pronounced in VLBW children Compared To SGA term and THUS May preclude a difference in IGF-I levels in the group of preterm children. The divergent effect in REE in SGA born at term born preterm SGA Compared to Compared to May Explain Their Counterparts AGA the divergent effects on IGF-I. This difference Might be a consequence of different timing in the exposure to intrauterine nutritional deficiency. © Freund Publishing House Ltd.;JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM;2009;Artículo;Pediatrics;0;sga;term;compar;aga;born;;0;0;0;10;3;10;3;15;45
332;4062;Birth weight and obesity risk at first grade in a cohort of Chilean children;The purpose of the study was to determine the association of birth weight as a risk factor for obesity at first grade in a cohort of Chilean children elementary school. Height and weight at birth and follow up measurements at first grade Were Analyzed from a national cohort of 119.070 new borns. Were subjects classified by anthropometric Characteristics: new born weight in kilograms, Ponderal Index (birth weight / height3 × 100), and gestational age (physical maturity) categories at birth. The study tested the hypothesis macrocosomic That a newborn (= 4,000 g or> 8.8 pounds) or Large for Gestational Age, would be at higher risk to be obese at first grade. A positive relationship Between Birth weight = 4.000 g, (OR = 1.55) (p> 0.001), high Ponderal Index (OR = 1.39) (p> 0.001), large for gestational age (OR = 1.51) (p> 0.001), and obesity was found at first grade. Macrosomic children Were more likely to be obese at first grade after controlling for the effects of confounding prenatal variables (OR = 1.67 (p <0.001). When weight gain Between birth and first grade was = 120% of reference value, the obesity risk was 20 times higher (p <0.001). A direct and statistically significant relationship Between high birth weight and obesity at first grade in this group of Chilean children Were Observed.

273;1314;Tumor cell death induced by the inhibition of mitochondrial electron transport: The effect of 3-hydroxybakuchiol;Changes in mitochondrial ATP synthesis can Affect the function of tumor cells due to the dependence of the first step of glycolysis on mitochondrial ATP. The oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system is responsible for the synthesis of approximately 90% of the ATP in the normal cells and up to 50% in MOST glycolytic cancers THEREFORE, inhibition of the electron transport chain (ETC) emerges as an attractive therapeutic target. We Studied the effect of a lipophilic isoprenylated catechol, 3-hydroxybakuchiol (3-OHbk), a putative inhibitor isolated from ETC Psoralea glandulosa. 3-OHbk exerted cytotoxic and anti-proliferative effects on the TA3 / Ha mouse mammary adenocarcinoma cell line and induced a decrease in the mitochondrial potential transmembrane, the activation of caspase-3, the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transport pore (MPTP) and nuclear DNA fragmentation. Additionally, 3-OHbk inhibited oxygen consumption, an effect That was completely reversed by succinate (an electron donor for Complex II) and duroquinol (electron donor for Complex III), suggesting That 3-OHbk disrupted the electron flow at the level of Complex I . The inhibition of OXPHOS did not Increase the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) but a large decrease Caused in the intracellular ATP level. ETC inhibitors shown to induce Have Been cell death through apoptosis and necrosis by increase increasing ROS generation. NEVERTHELESS, we Demonstrated 3-OHbk That inhibited the apoptosis induced ETC and through an interaction With Complex I. By delivering electrons to Complex III Directly With duroquinol, cell death was almost completely abrogated. These results Suggest That 3-OHbk have antitumor activity RESULTING from interactions With the ETC, a system That Is Already deficient in cancer cells. © 2 Elsevier Inc.;TOXICOLOGY AND APPLIED PHARMACOLOGY;2013;Artículo;Pharmacology & pharmacy;0;ohbk;complex;electron;etc;atp;;0;0;0;5;5;5;8;11;12
274;1455;Additive effect of rimonabant and citalopram on extracellular serotonin levels monitored with in vivo microdialysis in rat brain;Current pharmacological therapies for depression, treats including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are far from ideal. The cannabinoid system has-been Implicated in Control of mood and emotional neural processing of information, and the modulation of serotonin (5-HT) release in the synaptic clefts. The aim of the present study was to Evaluate Whether the combination of a selective SSRI (citalopram) with a selective cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist (rimonabant) Represents a more effective strategy than the antidepressant alone to Enhance serotonergic transmission. For th purpose extracellular 5-HT levels Were Monitored With microdialysis in forebrain (cortex prefrontal PFC) and mesencephalic (locus coeruleus, LC) terminal serotonergic areas in awake rats freely. Rimonabant at 10 mg / kg, i.p., but not at 3 mg / kg i.p. Increased 5HT in Both areas. Citalopram at 3, 5 and 10 mg / kg i.p. Increased 5HT Both in PFC and LC in a dose-dependent manner. The effect of citalopram (5 mg / kg, i.p.) on 5-HT levels was enhanced by rimonabant at Significantly 10 mg / kg, i.p. but not at 3 mg / kg i.p. Both in areas. The present results Demonstrate That the cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist rimonabant is able to Enhance in an additive manner the citalopram-induced 5-HT Increase of Concentrations in serotonergic areas terminal. The combination of a cannabinoid antagonist and a SSRI May Provide a novel strategy to Increase 5-HT availability, reducing the dose of SSRIs, and Potentially decreasing the time lag for the clinical onset of the antidepressant effect. © 2 Elsevier B.V.;EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY;2013;Artículo;Pharmacology & pharmacy;0;area;cannabinoid;citalopram;rimonab;antagonist;;0;0;0;12;6;12;9;4;11

279;2007;Previous administration of naltrexone did not change synergism between paracetamol and tramadol in mice;In the treatment of acute and chronic pain the Most Frequently used drugs are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), e.g., acetaminophen opioids, e.g., tramadol, and a group of drugs called coanalgesics or adjuvants (e.g., antidepressants, anticonvulsants). The aim of This work was to determine the nature of the interaction induced by intraperitoneal or intrathecal coadministration of acetaminophen and tramadol. The type of interaction was EVALUATED by Means of isobolographic analysis, using the acetic acid writhing test in mice as an algesiometer. In Addition, the Involvement of opioid receptors in the interaction was Studied using naltrexone, a non-selective opioid receptor antagonist. The administration of paracetamol or tramadol induced a dose-dependent antinociceptive activity in the assay. The dose-response curves Were Characterized by equal but different potencies efficacy, being i.t. paracetamol 11.84 times more potent than i.p. paracetamol, and i.t. tramadol 3.54 times more potent than the i.p. tramadol. The isobolographic analysis Indicates a synergistic interaction Between the coadministration of i.p. or i.t. With tramadol paracetamol. The interaction index values <U+200B><U+200B>Were like for the i.p. and i.t. With coadministration values <U+200B><U+200B>of 0.414 and 0.364, respectively. The Different Mechanisms of action of paracetamol and tramadol Explain the analgesic synergism strongly Between them, generally in agreement With the theory of drug interaction. This synergic interaction was not modified by the non selective opioid antagonist, naltrexone.

Trimetazidine (TMZ), a partial inhibitor of lipid oxidation, Has Been Proposed as a metabolic modulator for cardiovascular pathologies Several. However, ITS mechanism of action is controversial. Given the fact That TMZ is able to alter mitochondrial metabolism, we EVALUATED the protective role of TMZ on mitochondrial morphology and function in an in vitro model of lipotoxicity induced by palmitate. We cultured rat cardiomyocytes Treated With BSA-conjugated palmitate (25 nM free) TMZ (0.1-100 .mu.M), or a combination of both. We EVALUATED mitochondrial morphology and lipid accumulation by confocal fluorescence microscopy, parameters of mitochondrial metabolism (mitochondrial membrane potential, oxygen consumption rate [OCR], and ATP levels), and ceramide production by indirect immunofluorescence and mass spectrometry. Palmitate Promoted mitochondrial fission evidenced by a decrease in mitochondrial volume (50%) and an Increase in the number of mitochondria per cell (80%), Whereas TMZ volume mitochondrial Increased (39%), and Decreased mitochondrial number (56%), suggesting mitochondrial fusion. Also Palmitate Decreased mitochondrial metabolism (ATP levels and OCR), while all the TMZ potentiated Assessed metabolic parameters. Mitochondrial, Moreover, pretreatment With the TMZ protected cardiomyocytes from palmitate-induced fission and dysfunction. Also TMZ Increased lipid accumulation in cardiomyocytes, and preventer palmitate-induced ceramide production. Our data show TMZ That Protects cardiomyocytes by changing intracellular lipid management. THUS, the beneficial effects of TMZ on Patients With different cardiovascular pathologies can be related to modulation of the mitochondrial morphology and function. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

285;2709;Synergism between dexketoprofen and meloxicam in an orofacial formalin test was not modified by opioid antagonists;Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are Among the MOST Widely used drugs for the management of acute and chronic pain. The role of the opioid system in the synergism is not well NSAIDs Between Characterized. Were Mice injected with a 5% formalin solution (20 ul) into the right upper lip to perform an orofacial formalin test. The isobolographic method was used to determine the interaction Between Dexketoprofen, Which is the (S) - (+) enantiomer of ketoprofen, meloxicam and co-administration. Additionally, the non-selective, opioid antagonist naltrexone, the selective d opioid receptor (DOP) antagonist naltrindole and the selective <U+03BA> opioid receptor (KOP) antagonist norbinaltorphimine Were used to ASSESS the opioid effects on This interaction. Intraperitoneal administration of meloxicam or Dexketoprofen induced dose-dependent antinociceptionwith different phase I and phase II potencies in the orofacial formalin test.Meloxicam like displayed potencies (ED50) in phase I (7.20 mg / kg) and phase II (8.60 mg / kg). Dexketoprofen was more potent in phase I (19.96 mg / kg) than in phase II (50.90 mg / kg). The interactions Between Dexketoprofen and meloxicam in synergistic Were Both phases. This was based on the determined to fixed ratios (1: 1) of Their ED50 values, Which Were Determined by isobolographic analysis. Furthermore, antinociceptive activity esta does not seem to be modulated by opioid receptor blockers did not induce Because They changes in the nature of esta interaction. This finding May be with regards to Relevant multi-modal analgesia NSAID Where an opioid antagonist must be used.

288;3138;Synergism between NSAIDs in the orofacial formalin test in mice;Opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used to highlight acute and chronic pain. The purpose of this study was to determine the degree of interaction Between Dexketoprofen and NSAIDS examples of COXs inhibitors using the isobolographic analysis in the orofacial formalin test in mice. The drugs, i.p., induced a dose-dependent antinociception With different potencies in test Both phases. Combinations of Dexketoprofen With naproxen, nimesulide, ibuprofen or paracetamol on the basis of the fixed ratio (1: 1) of Their ED50's values <U+200B><U+200B>alone Demonstrated synergism in Both phases. This is Important since the orofacial pain is a test not used in Currently mice The drugs are all Analgesic for humans and phase II is representative of inflammatory pain. The synergism was: COX-3 & gt COX-2 & gt COX-1 inhibitors, since this is Particularly interesting the inhibitor of COX-3, paracetamol, robusta displayed anti-inflammatory activity in an assay of acute inflammatory pain and inflammatory pain That Mimics in humans.

292;3217;Perception of the Usefulness of Drug/Gene Pairs and Barriers for Pharmacogenomics in Latin America;Pharmacogenetics and Pharmacogenomics areas are focused Currently emerging fields to manage pharmacotherapy That May Prevent Avoiding undertreatment while associated drug toxicity in patients. Large international Differences in the awareness and use of pharmacogenomic in the testing are presumed, but not well Assessed to date. In the present study we review the awareness of Latin American scientific community About pharmacogenomic testing and the perceived barriers for Their clinical application. In order to That, We Have compiled information from 9 Countries of the region using a structured survey Which is Compared with previously performed in surveys With USA and Spain. The most Relevant group of barriers was related to the need for clear guidelines for the use of pharmacogenomics in clinical practice, followed by pharmacogenomics Among About Insufficient awareness and the absence of clinicians Regulatory Institutions That Facilitate the use of pharmacogenetic tests. The higher RANKED Were pairs TPMT / thioguanine, TPMT / azathioprine, CYP2C9 / warfarin, UGT1A1 / irinotecan, CYP2D6 / amitriptyline, CYP2C19 / citalopram and CYP2D6 / clozapine. The lower RANKED Were pairs SLCO1B1 / Simvastatin, CYP2D6 / metoprolol and GP6D / chloroquine. Compared With USA and Spanish surveys, 25 pairs of lower Were Importance for Latin American Respondents. Only CYP2C19 / esomeprazole, CYP2C19 / omeprazole, CYP2C19 / celecoxib and G6PD / dapsone Were RANKED or higher similarly to the USA and Spanish surveys. Integration of pharmacogenomics in clinical practice training needs of healthcare professionals and Citizens, but in legal and regulatory guidelines Addition and Safeguards will be needed.

297;3596;Maternal exposure to cadmium during gestation perturbs the vascular system of the adult rat offspring;Several cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in adulthood Have Been Observed With environmental influences associated During fetal growth. Here, we show That maternal exposure to cadmium, a heavy metal and ubiquitously distributed main component of cigarette smoke is able to induce cardiovascular morpho-functional changes in the offspring at adult age. Heart and vascular reactivity morphology Were EVALUATED in the adult offspring of rats exposed to 30 ppm of cadmium During Pregnancy. Echocardiographic examination shows Characterized by altered morphology heart left ventricular hypertrophy Concentric. Also, we Observed at reduced endothelium-dependent reactivity in isolated aortic rings of adult offspring, while endothelium-independent reactivity Remained unaltered. These effects associated Were With An Increase of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression in the aortas of adult offspring. The expression of HO-1 was higher in females than evils, to finding likely related to the sex-dependent expression of the vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), Which was lower in the adult female. All These long-term Consequences Were Observed Along With average birth weights and absence of detectable levels of cadmium in fetal and adult tissues of the offspring. In placental tissues however, cadmium levels Were detected and correlated With Increased NF-KB expression - transcription factor to inflammation and oxidative sensitive to stress - suggesting a mechanism placentary That Affect genes related to the development of the cardiovascular system.Our results Provide, for the first time, direct experimental evidence supporting That exposure to cadmium During Pregnancy reprograms cardiovascular development of the offspring Which in turn leads to a May long term Increased risk of CVD. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.;TOXICOLOGY AND APPLIED PHARMACOLOGY;2011;Artículo;Pharmacology & pharmacy;0;adult;offspr;cadmium;cardiovascular;observ;;0;0;0;13;6;13;8;17;14

Additionally, apoptosis in vascular statins Promote smooth muscle cells, renal tubular epithelial cells in and Present in a variety of cell lines yet, the effects of statins on cardiac fibroblast and myofibroblast, Primarily responsible for cardiac tissue healing are almost unknown. Here, we Investigated the effects of simvastatin on cardiac fibroblast and myofibroblast viability and cell death Studied the molecular mechanism triggered by simvastatin in Both cell types. Methods: Rat neonatal cardiac fibroblasts and myofibroblasts Were Treated With simvastatin (0.1-10µM) up to 72 h. Cell viability and apoptosis by trypan blue Were EVALUATED exclusion method and by flow cytometry, respectively. Caspase-3 activation and Rho protein levels and activity Present Were Determined by Western blot and pull-down assay, respectively. Results: Simvastatin induces caspase-dependent apoptosis of cardiac fibroblasts and myofibroblasts in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, with greater effects on fibroblasts than myofibroblasts. These effects Were preventer by mevalonate, farnesylpyrophosphate and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate, but not squalene. These last results Suggest That apoptosis was dependent on small GTPases of the Rho family rather than Ras. Conclusion: Simvastatin apoptosis triggered cardiac fibroblasts and myofibroblasts of by a mechanism independent of cholesterol synthesis, but dependent of isoprenilation of Rho protein. Additionally, cardiac fibroblasts more susceptible to Were simvastatin-induced apoptosis than cardiac myofibroblasts.

301;3837;Antinociceptive effects of morphine, fentanyl, tramadol and their combination, in morphine-tolerant mice;The development of morphine-tolerance after chronic administration, you reduce analgesic efficacy and is a significant clinical problem in some Patients May be managed clinically by Increasing the doses of morphine and / or the administration of a mu-opioid agonist second. In morphine-tolerant mice, we Investigated the presence of an interaction When two opioids are administered Simultaneously. We determined to the antinociceptive effects of morphine (M), fentanyl (FEN), and tramadol (TRM) individually and combined in a 1: 1 proportion, based on Their potency. Were EVALUATED nociceptive thresholds in CD1 mice using the hot plate test. Morphine tolerance was induced by the subcutaneous implantation of a 75mg morphine pellet, Whereas Control animals received a placebo pellet Were the experiments performed three days later. Both In (placebo and morphine pellets), dose-response curves for M, FEN and TRM, individually and combined Were Obtained, and the 50% twos That produced inhibition (ED50) Were determined. Sustained exposure to morphine induced antinociceptive a significant decrease in potency to acute M or FEN administration (tolerance), Which was of a lesser magnitude after acute TRM These experiments in the analysis of the interaction Between each morphine and chronic opioid, Demonstrated functional antagonism. The simultaneous administration of two opioids in morphine-tolerant mice, Demonstrated antagonism for the M: FEN combination thereof, Whereas the effects of TRM combined with M or FEN, Remained additive. The results Suggest That During morphine-tolerance, TRM Could be a useful drug to induce effective analgesia When combined With FEN or M. © 2 Elsevier Inc.;PHARMACOLOGY BIOCHEMISTRY AND BEHAVIOR;2010;Artículo;Pharmacology & pharmacy;0;morphin;fen;toler;combin;trm;;0;0;0;13;6;13;2;4;11

306;4061;Effects of tramadol and dexketoprofen on analgesia and gastrointestinal transit in mice;The purpose of the present study was to Evaluate the nature of the antinociceptive interaction Among Dexketoprofen (DEX), a inhibitor mixed of the cyclo-oxygenases, and tramadol (TRAM), a weak opioid With monoaminergic activity That Inhibits norepinephrine and serotonin re-uptake . We Assessed antinociception in the acetic acid writhing test, the tail flick and the formalin (FT) tests, and gastrointestinal transit (GIT) after the administration of a charcoal meal. The analysis of the interaction was Carried out using isobolograms and interaction indexes or the fixed-dose method GIT. The administration of DEX or TRAM individually induced dose-dependent antinociception in all the algesiometric tests. In the three tests, TRAM was Between 5.2 (FT, phase I) and 35 times (FT, Phase II) more potent than DEX. When testing combinations at different potency ratios (1: 1, 1: 3, 3: 1), We Could Demonstrate synergy in all algesiometric tests, drugs Were Only When combined in a 1: 1 proportion. Interestingly, the proportion of the drugs in the combination Could change the type of interaction from synergy to antagonism. On the inhibition of GIT, a dose-related inhibition was established for TRAM, but not for DEX. Using a fixed-dose protocol, We Could Demonstrate Between DEX and TRAM antagonism on the inhibition of GIT.

Glucocorticoids are effective to reduce the engine disability in These Patients, but ITS role as anti-spastic drugs is unknown. Here it is the use of corticosteroids Reported in HAM / TSP. The goal was to find molecular markers linked to reliable treatment effectiveness. The clinical efficacy of corticosteroids was Studied in 22 HAM / TSP. The treatment was a single dose of 7.0mg of systemic betamethasone. Pre-treatment samples Were Obtained Immediately before administration and steroid post-treatment samples after 5 days Were Collected. Neurological disability was EVALUATED by the Osame's Motor Disability Scales. CD4 Relative levels of Tax, Foxp3, IL-10, TGF-ß, CTLA4, and GITR mRNA Were Measured and the percentage of CD4 + Foxp3 + and + Tax + Populations was Quantified in PBMCs by Real-time PCR and flow cytometry , respectively. The same parameters Were Studied in eight untreated carriers. Betamethasone treatment Showed neurological improvement in 21 HAM / TSP Patients, with one patient without response to treatment. This therapy was associated with a decrease in mRNA Tax load and CD4 + T cells in Tax + HAM / TSP. Simultaneously, an Increase in Foxp3 mRNA and CD4 + Foxp3 + T cell was detected in These patients.

The present study was to characterize the antinociceptive Undertaken interaction of morphine With different non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) isobolographic using the writhing test and analysis of mice. One of the possible Mechanisms of action of morphine administered spinally non-steroidal antiinflammatory With drugs was Investigated using the DOR antagonist naltrindole. The Study Demonstrated a synergistic antinociception of spinal morphine administered combinations of agents With the following NSAIDs: diclofenac, ketoprofen, meloxicam, metamizol, naproxen, nimesulide, parecoxib and piroxicam. The supraadditive effect Seems to be independent of the selectivity of each NSAIDs to inhibit COX-1 or COX-2. The findings of the present work Suggest That the combinations of opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have a direct action on spinal processing of the nociceptive information, Which May Achieved by additional Mechanisms independent of prostaglandin synthesis inhibition and / or activation of opioid receptors .

234;1236;A malignant hyperthermia-inducing mutation in RYR1 (R163C): consequent alterations in the functional properties of DHPR channels;Bidirectional Communication between the 1,4-dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) in the plasma membrane and the ryanodine receptor type 1 (RYR1) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is responsible for skeletal-type Both excitation-contraction coupling (voltage-gated Ca2 + release from the SR) and Increased amplitude of L-type Ca2 + current via the DHPR. Because the DHPR and RYR1 are functionally coupled, mutations in RYR1 That are linked to malignant hyperthermia (MH) May Affect DHPR activity. For esta reason, we Investigated Whether cultured myotubes Originating from mice carrying an MH-linked mutation in RYR1 (R163C) ADH altered voltage-gated Ca2 + release from the SR, membrane-bound charge movement, and / or L-type Ca 2+ current . In myotubes homozygous (Horn) for the R163C mutation, voltage-gated Ca2 + release from the SR Substantially was reduced and shifted (~10 mV) to more hyperpolarizing potentials Compared With wild-type (WT) myotubes. Intramembrane charge movements of Both Hom and heterozygous (Het) myotubes displayed hyperpolarizing shifts similar to voltagegated That Observed in SR Ca2 + release. The current-voltage relationships for L-type currents in Both Hom and Het myotubes Were shifted to more Present hyperpolarizing potentials (~7 and 5 mV, respectively). Compared With WT myotubes, Het and Horn myotubes Both displayed a greater sensitivity to the L-type channel agonist Bay K 8644 ± (10 uM). In General, L-type currents in WT, Het, and Hom myotubes inactivated after 30-s modesdy prepulses to -50, -10, 0, 10, 20, and 30 mV. However, L-type currents in Hom myotubes hyperpolarizing shift in displayed to inactivation relative to L-type currents in WT Either or Het myotubes.

Skeletal muscle fibers, Which Have unusually high cholesterol levels in transverse tubules, express the caveolin-3 isoform but ITS association with transverse tubules remains contentious. Cholesterol removal excitation-contraction coupling impairs in amphibian and mammalian fetal skeletal muscle fibers. Here, we show single muscle fibers That treating adult mice from removing agent With the cholesterol-ß-cyclodextrin methyl fiber Decreased by 26% cholesterol, altered the location pattern of caveolin-3 and of the voltage dependent calcium channel Cav1.1, and suppressed or electrically evoked reduced Ca2 + transients without Affecting membrane sarcoplasmic reticulum integrity Causing or calcium depletion. We found That transverse tubules from adult muscle and triad fractions That Contain ~ 10% attached transverse tubules, sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes but not, contained caveolin-3 and Cav1.1 Both proteins partitioned into detergent-resistant membrane fractions highly enriched in cholesterol. Aging entails significant deterioration of skeletal muscle function.

This effect was dependent on intracellular calcium augmentation, since preincubation With BAPTA (an intracellular calcium chelator) or thapsigargin [Sarco (endo) plasmic reticulum Ca2 + -ATPase (SERCA) pump inhibitor] Significantly attenuated esta effect. Similarly, U73122 (a phospholipase C inhibitor) or 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate [2-APB, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate an (IP3) receptor (IP3R) inhibitor] esta reduced effect. Block of ethanol action after preincubation was Present Achieved With Rp-cAMPS, inhibitor of the adenylate cyclase (AC) / PKA signaling pathway.

244;1704;Prenatal testosterone excess alters Sertoli and germ cell number and testicular FSH receptor expression in rams;Exposure to excess testosterone (T) During fetal life have a profound impact on the metabolic and reproductive functions in the female's postnatal life. However, less is Known About the effects of excess testosterone in evils. The aim of the present study was to Evaluate the Impact (Consequences) of an excess of fetal development on T During mature male testis. The testicular evaluation was by histological analysis and by determination of mRNA expression of the FSH receptor (FSH-R), transforming growth factor-ß type I receptor (TßR-I), and two members of the TGF-ß superfamily, transforming growth factor -ß3 (TGF b3) and anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) in born to mothers evils receiving an excess of T During Pregnancy. At 42 wk of age, postpubertal evils born to mothers Treated With 30 mg of T propionate twice weekly from day 30 to 90, followed by 40 mg of T propionate from day 90 to 120 of pregnancy (T ills) Showed higher Concentrations of FSH in response to a GnRH analog, a higher number of Sertoli cells / seminiferous tubule cross-section, and a lower number of germ cells / tubules (P <0.05) than evils control (C ills) born to mothers Treated with the vehicle. The mRNA expression of FSH-R and of TßR-I was higher in T evils Compared with C diseases (P <0.05). , Moreover, in T evils, AMH expression level negatively correlated With the expression level of TGF b3. In C evils, esta Latter was not Observed correlation. These results Suggest That prenatal exposure to an excess of T can negatively modify some histological and molecular Characteristics of the mature testis.

245;1716;Endocytic pathway of exogenous iron-loaded ferritin in intestinal epithelial (Caco-2) cells;Ferritin, a food constituent of the animal and vegetable origin, is a source of dietary iron. Its central hollow cavity has the capacity to store up to 4,500 Atoms of iron, so ITS as an iron donor potential is Advantageous to heme iron, present in meats and inorganic mineral iron of vegetable origin or animal. In intestinal cells, ferritin internalization by endocytosis results in the release of iron into the cytosolic ITS labile iron pool. The aim of study was to characterize esta the endocytic pathway of exogenous ferritin absorbed from the intestinal epithelium apical membrane of Caco-2 cells, using microscopy and transmission electron Both confocal fluorescence microscopy. Confocal microscopy revealed That endocytosis of exogenous AlexaFluor 488-labeled ferritin was Initiated by ITS engulfment by clathrin-coated pits and internalization into endosomes early, as Determined by codistribution With clathrin and early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1). AlexaFluor 488-labeled ferritin With The Present codistributed autophagosome microtubuleassociated marker protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) and the lysosome marker lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2). Transmission electron microscopy revealed That exogenously added ferritin was captured in plasmalemmal pits, double-membrane compartments, and multivesicular bodies and lysosomes as autophagosomes Considered. Biochemical experiments revealed That the lysosome inhibitor chloroquine and the autophagosome inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) <U+200B><U+200B>inhibited degradation of exogenously added 131I-labeled ferritin.

We Have recently shown That in vitro, etoposide induces upregulation of TACE / ADAM17 and ADAM10, two membrane-bound extracellular metalloproteases. Here we show That in vivo These Enzymes are Involved in etoposide-, but not in heat Shock-, induced apoptosis in rat spermatogenesis. Germ cell apoptosis induced by DNA damage was associated With An Increase in protein levels and cell surface localization of TACE / ADAM17 and ADAM10. On the Contrary, apoptosis of germ cells induced by heat stress, cell death another stimulus, did not change levels or localization of These proteins.

Heme oxygenase 1 and Hsp70 (hmox-1) are induced by a variety of cellular stressors in skeletal muscle, playing a role in long-term adaptations and muscle fibers regeneration. Though HSPs expression after exercise intensely Has Been Investigated, Molecular Mechanisms Concerning the Hsp70 and hmox-1 induction are poorly Understood. The aim of This work was to investigate the Involvement of calcium in Hsp70 and hmox-1 expression upon depolarization of skeletal muscle cells. We depolarization of myotubes Observed That Increased mRNA levels and protein Both expression for Hsp70 and hmox-1. Stimulation in the presence of intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA-AM Resulted in a complete inhibition of Hsp70-induced expression. It is Known That inositol 1,4,5-trisphophate (IP3) - mediated Ca2 + transients slow, evoked by membrane depolarization, are Involved in the regulation of gene expression.

248;1910;Xanthine oxidase and the fetal cardiovascular defence to hypoxia in late gestation ovine pregnancy;Hypoxia is a common challenge to the fetus, Promoting a physiological defense to redistribute blood flow towards the brain and away from peripheral circulations. During acute hypoxia, reactive oxygen species (ROS) Interact with nitric oxide (NO) to Provide an oxidant tone. This Contributes to the Mechanisms Redistributing the fetal cardiac output, the source of ROS, Although is unknown. Here, we Investigated derived from ROS Whether xanthine oxidase (XO) Contribute to the peripheral fetal vasoconstrictor response to hypoxia via interaction with No-dependent Mechanisms. Pregnant ewes and Their fetuses Were surgically prepared for long-term recording at 118 days of gestation (term approximately 145 days). After 5 days of recovery, mothers Were infused i.v. for 30 min With Either vehicle (n = 11), low dose (30 mg kg-1, n = 5) or high dose (150 mg kg-1, n = 9) allopurinol, or high dose allopurinol With fetal NO blockade ( n = 6). Following treatment allopurinol, fetal hypoxia was induced by reducing maternal inspired O2 Such That fetal basal P aO 2 Decreased by 50% for approximately 30 min. Allopurinol inhibited the Increase in fetal plasma uric acid and suppressed the fetal femoral vasoconstrictor, and lactate acidaemic glycemic responses During hypoxia (all P & lt 0.05) effects That Were restored to levels Control with fetal NO blockade.

250;2062;Mitochondrial fragmentation impairs insulin-dependent glucose uptake by modulating Akt activity through mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake;Insulin is a major regulator of glucose metabolism, stimulating mitochondrial oxidation in skeletal ITS muscle cells. Mitochondria are dynamic organelles That can undergo structural remodeling in order to cope With These everchanging metabolic Demands. However, the process by Which impacts mitochondrial insulin signaling in the skeletal muscle cells morphology remains uncertain. To address This question, we silenced the mitochondrial proteins Mfn2 and OPA1 and Assessed insulin-dependent responses in L6 rat skeletal muscle cells fusion.

We Assessed IL-6 expression in response to electrical stimulation (ES) or extracellular ATP as a mediator of the excitation Known-transcription mechanism in skeletal muscle. We Examined Whether the canonical signaling cascade downstream of IL-6 (IL-6 / JAK2 / Stat3) Responds to muscle cell Present excitation, concluding That IL-6 influences Its Own expression through a positive loop. Either ES or exogenous ATP (100 uM) Increased expression Both IL-6 and p-STAT3 levels in rat myotubes, a process inhibited by suramin and 100 .mu.M 2 U / ml apyrase. Present ATP evoked IL-6 expression in isolated skeletal Both fibers and extracts derived from whole FDB muscles. Increased ATP IL-6 release up to 10-fold. STAT3 activation evoked by ATP was abolished by the JAK2 inhibitor HBC. Blockade of secreted IL-6 with a neutralizing antibody or STAT3 inhibitor preincubation With the reduced STAT3 activation VIII evoked by extracellular ATP by 70%.

OL-like secondary structures are FORMED Also by heavy strand DNA templating for the five tRNAs adjacent to OLs, the Wancy tRNA cluster. We tested Whether naturally associates OL absence With greater Capacities for formation of OL-like structures by Wancy tRNA genes. Using lepidosaurian taxa (Sphenodon, lizards and amphisbaenids), we Wancy Compared to form OL Capacities tRNA-like structures 248 taxa Possessing an Between OL OL without With 131 taxa (from different families). On average, Wancy tRNA genes form more OL-like structures in the absence of a normal OL than in Its presence. Formation of OL-like hierarchical structures by Wancy tRNAs That Follows patterns May reduce competition Between the tRNA's Translational OL function and Its secondary function: the rarer the cognate amino acid tRNA's, the greater the capacity to form OL-like structures. High OL-forming Capacities for Neighboring tRNAs are avoided. Because OL absence Usually OCCURS in taxa With reduced genomes, formation of Increased OL-like structures by Wancy tRNAs Might result from selection for greater metabolic efficiency.

In the present study, we Investigated the combined effects of exercise and moderate altitude on redox balance in ten endurance exercising biathletes, and five sedentary volunteers 6-week During stay at 2.800-m. As a marker for oxidative stress, hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) was Analyzed by the biosensor measuring system Ecocheck , and 8-iso prostaglandin F2a (PGF2a 8-iso) was determined to by enzyme immunoassay in Exhaled breath condensate (EBC). To determine the whole blood antioxidative capacity, we reduced Measured glutathione (GSH) enzymatically using Ellman's reagent. Exercising athletes and sedentary volunteers Showed Increased levels of oxidative markers at moderate altitude, Contrary to our expectations there was no difference Between Both groups. THEREFORE, all subjects' data pooled to examine Were the oxidative stress response due to altitude exposure Exclusively. H 2 O 2 at altitude and Increased levels Remained elevated for 3 days after returning to sea level (p = 0.05). On the other hand, 8-iso PGF2 levels Showed a tendency to Increase at altitude, but Declined Immediately after returning to sea level (p = 0.001).

255;3257;Dynamics of Stimulus-Evoked Spike Timing Correlations in the Cat Lateral Geniculate Nucleus;Precisely synchronized neuronal activity commonly Has Been Observed in the mammalian visual pathway. Spike timing correlations in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) take the form of Often phase synchronized oscillations in the high gamma frequency range. To study the relations Between oscillatory activity, synchrony, and Their time-dependent properties, we recorded activity from multiple single units in the cat LGN under stimulation by stationary spots of light. Autocorrelation analysis Showed That approximately one third of the cells exhibited oscillatory firing with a mean frequency 80 Hz. Cross-correlation analysis Showed 30% of unit That Showed significant synchronization pairs, and 61% of These pairs consisted of synchronous oscillations. That crosscorrelation analysis assumes synchronous firing is stationary and maintained Throughout the period of stimulation. We tested esta assumption by Applying unitary events analysis (UEA). We found That UEA was more sensitive to weak and transient synchrony than cross-correlation analysis and detected a higher incidence (49% of cell pairs) of significant synchrony (unitary events). In many unit pairs, the unitary events Were Characterized optimally at a bin width of 1 ms, indicating neural synchrony That has a high degree of temporal precision. We also found approximately one half That unit pairs of the nonstationary changes in synchrony Showed That Could not Be Predicted by the modulation of firing rates. Population statistics Showed That the onset of synchrony Between LGN cells occurred later than That Significantly Observed Between Retinal afferents and LGN cells. The synchrony detected Among unit recorded on separate pairs tetrodes Tended to be more transient and have a later onset than That Observed Between adjacent units. These findings show That stimulus-evoked synchronous activity Within the LGN is Rhythmic Often, highly nonstationary, and modulated by endogenous Processes That are not tightly correlated firing With rate.

In This study, we EVALUATED the chronic effects of TNFa, IL-6, and IL-1ß on mitochondrial metabolism and adipocyte morphology using the 3T3-L1 cell model system. TNFa treatment of cultured adipocytes led to significant changes in mitochondrial bioenergetics, Including Increased proton leak, <U+0394><U+03A8>m Decreased basal Increased respiration, ATP and Decreased turnover. In contrast, IL-6, Although IL-1ß and maximal Decreased respiratory capacity, no effect on They Had <U+0394><U+03A8>m and varied effects on ATP turnover, proton leak, or basal respiration. Only TNFa treatment of 3T3-L1 cells led to an Increase in oxidative stress (as Measured by production and protein superoxide anion carbonylation) and C16 ceramide synthesis.

This is a dynamically balanced process coordinated by positive and negative signals: such as the insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-1) and myostatin (MSTN), respectively. In This study, we report the stimulation of skeletal That myoblasts During differentiation With IGF-1 induces a rapid and transient intracellular calcium Increase from stores, Which are mediated through Principally the phospholipase C gamma (PLC <U+03B3>) / inositol 1,4,5- triphosphate (IP3) -dependent signaling pathways. This response was completely blocked When myoblasts Were incubated With LY294002 or transfected With the dominant-negative p110 gamma, suggesting a critical role of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) in PLC<U+03B3> activation. Additionally, we show That IP3 and calcium released via induced by IGF-1 Stimulates NFAT-dependent gene transcription and nuclear translocation of the GFP-labeled NFATc3 isoform. This activation was independent of extracellular calcium Influx and calcium release mediated by ryanodine receptor (RyR).

We searched for slow calcium signals in adult muscle fibers using digitorum brevis isolated adult flexor fibers from 5-7-wk-old mice, fluo-3 loaded With. When stimulated with Trains of 0.3-ms pulses at various frequencies, cells Responded with a fast calcium signal associated with muscle contraction, followed by a slower-like signal to one in cultured myotubes Described Previously. Nifedipine inhibited the slow signal more than the fast one Effectively, suggesting a role for DHPR in Its onset. The IP3R inhibitors xestospongin B or C (5 uM) Present it inhibited. The amplitude of post-tetanic calcium transients depends on frequency and duration Both tetanus, Having a maximum at 10 to 20 Hz. At this frequency stimulation, an Increase of the slow isoform of troponin I mRNA was detected, while the fast isoform of esta gene was inhibited. All three isoforms IP3R Were present in adult muscle. IP3R-1 was differentially Expressed in different types of muscle fibers, being higher in a subset of fast-type fibers. Interestingly, fibers isolated from the slow soleus muscle did not reveal the slow calcium induced by electrical stimulus signal.

Here we review the emerging data on how Communication between endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria can modulate cellular organelle function and determine fate. © 2 Bentham Science Publishers.;CURRENT MOLECULAR MEDICINE;2013;Artículo;Physiology;0;endoplasm;reticulum;mitochondria;organell;cellular;;0;0;0;5;5;5;9;11;12
262;4286;Progesterone Utilizes Distinct Membrane Pools of Tissue Factor to Increase Coagulation and Invasion and These Effects are Inhibited by TFPI;Tissue factor (TF) serving as the receptor for coagulation factor VII (FVII) Initiates the extrinsic coagulation pathway. We Previously Demonstrated That Increases progesterone TF, coagulation and invasion in breast cancer cell lines. Herein, if we Investigated tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) Could down-Regulate progesterone-Increased activity in TF These cells. Classically, TFPI redistributes TF-FVII-FX-TFPI in an inactive quaternary complex associated to membrane lipid raft regions. Herein, we Demonstrate That TF Increased by progesterone is localized to the heavy membrane fraction, DESPITE Increased progesterone-Exclusively from almost Originating coagulation lipid raft domains, Where TF levels are extremely low. The progesterone Increase in coagulation is not a rapid effect, but is progesterone receptor (PR) dependent and requires protein synthesis. , Although a partial relocalization of TF OCCURS, TFPI does not require the redistribution to lipid rafts to inhibit coagulation or invasion. Inhibition by TFPI and anti-TF antibodies in lipid raft membrane fractions confirmed the dependence on TF for progesterone-mediated coagulation. Through the use of pathway inhibitors, we further Demonstrate That the TF up-regulated by progesterone is not coupled to the progesterone Increase in TF-mediated coagulation. However, the progesterone up-regulated protein TF May be Involved in progesterone-mediated breast cancer cell invasion, Which Inhibits Also TFPI. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.;JOURNAL OF CELLULAR PHYSIOLOGY;2011;Artículo;Physiology;0;progesteron;coagul;tfpi;lipid;raft;;0;0;0;5;5;12;8;16;14
263;4435;Long-term exposure to high-altitude chronic hypoxia during gestation induces neonatal pulmonary hypertension at sea level;We Determined Whether postnatal pulmonary hypertension induced by pregnancy at 70% of high altitude (HA) persists eleven the offspring return to sea level and pulmonary vascular Investigated Mechanisms operating under These Circumstances. Pregnant ewes Were divided into two groups: conception, pregnancy, and delivery at low altitude (580 m, LLL) and conception at low altitude, pregnancy at HA (3.600 m) from 30% of gestation Until delivery, and return to lowland (LHL ). Pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) was Measured in vivo. Vascular reactivity and morphometry Were Assessed in small pulmonary arteries (SPA). Protein expression of vascular Mediators was determined. LHL lambs ADH higher baseline PAP and a greater increment in PAP after -nitro-L- arginine methyl ester (20.9 ± 1.1 mmHg vs. 13.7 ± 0.5 39.9 ± 5.0 vs. 18.3 ± 1.3 mmHg, respectively). SPA from LHL had a greater maximal contraction to K + (1.34 ± 0.05 vs. 1.16 ± 0.05 N / m), higher sensitivity to endothelin-1 and nitroprusside, and persistence of dilatation of soluble guanylate following blockade cyclase. The heart ratio of the right ventricle-to-left ventricle plus septum was higher in the LHL relative to LLL. The muscle area of <U+200B><U+200B>SPA (29.3 ± 2.9 vs. 21.1 ± 1.7%) and the protein expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (1.7 ± 0.1 vs. 1.1 ± 0.2), phosphodiesterase (1.4 ± 0.1 vs. 0.7 ± 0.1), and Ca2 + -activated K + channel (0.76 ± 0.16 vs. 0.30 ± 0.01) greater in LHL Were Compared With LLL lambs. In contrast, heme oxygenase LHL Decreased ADH-1 expression (0.82 ± 0.26 vs. 2.22 ± 0.44) and carbon monoxide production (all P & lt 0.05).

264;4436;Store-operated channels in the pulmonary circulation of high- and low-altitude neonatal lambs;We determined to Whether store-operated channels (SOC) are Involved in neonatal pulmonary artery function under conditions of acute and chronic hypoxia, using newborn sheep gestated and born Either at high altitude (HA, 3.600 m) or low altitude (LA, 520 m) . Cardiopulmonary variables Were recorded in vivo, with and without blockade by SOC 2-aminoethyldiphenylborinate (2-APB), or acute hypoxic During basal conditions. 2-APB did not Have effects on basal mean arterial pulmonary pressure (mPAP), cardiac output, systemic arterial blood pressure, systemic vascular resistance or in groups of neonates Both. During acute hypoxia 2-APB mPAP and pulmonary vascular reduced resistance in LA and HA, But This reduction was greater in HA. In Addition, isolated pulmonary arteries mounted in a wire myograph Were Assessed for vascular reactivity. He arteries Showed a greater relaxation and sensitivity to SOC blockers than LA arteries. The pulmonary expression of two SOC-forming subunits, TRPC4 and STIM1, was upregulated in HA. Taken together, our results show That SOC hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction to Contribute in newborn sheep and SOC are upregulated That by chronic hypoxia. THEREFORE, SOC May Contribute to the development of neonatal pulmonary hypertension. We propose SOC channels Could be potential targets to treat neonatal pulmonary hypertension. © 2 the American Physiological Society.;AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LUNG CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR PHYSIOLOGY;2013;Artículo;Physiology;0;pulmonari;soc;arteri;neonat;acut;;0;0;0;13;8;13;8;17;43
265;4525;A visual cue modulates the firing rate and latency of auditory-cortex neurons in the chinchilla;We Studied single and multi-unit activity recorded With tetrodes, from the left auditory cortex of awake while chinchillas They performed a frequency discrimination task. Auditory stimuli Were Preceded by a visual cue silent. We Examined firing rates and first-spike latencies of 181 units in the presence and absence of the visual cue. To discard possible auditory artifacts produced by the visual cue, cochlear potentials recorded by an Simultaneously Were Positioned at the electrode round window of the cochlea right. We found That the visual stimulus altered the firing rate and the mean first-spike latency of 9% and 18% of the recorded auditory cortex-cells, respectively. Furthermore, we found That the subset of neurons in Which the firing rate was modulated by the visual cue was distinct from the subset of neurons that changed Their presence in the latency of the visual cue. Adding Both groups, a visual stimulus-modulated firing Characteristics of the 27% of the recorded auditory neurons in the cortex-awake chinchilla.

203;211;Cognitive impairment in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia: A systematic review;Aims: Previous comparisons of cognitive decline bipolar disorder Among Patients With (BD) and schizophrenia (SZ) Have somehow found quite like profiles of deficits, but results varied Have Between studies. THEREFORE an extensive and thoughtful systematic review of the matter is warranted. Methods: Studies Were found through systematic search (PubMed) PRISMA following guidelines. To be included, studies must have Assessed the following cognitive functions: executive functions, memory, IQ, attention-concentration, and perceptuomotor function. In order to make comparison Between the two entities, BD include studies Should Patients With operationally defined euthymia, Schizophrenic Patients in Remission, and third group of healthy Patients control. Comparisons Were Made after years of schooling for controlling and residual affective symptoms. Results: We found That overall SZ and BD Both Patients present on all neurocognitive deficits Compared to healthy controls Measures. In particularly, SZ Patients show more severe and pervasive cognitive deficits while BD Patients present a milder and more confined impairment. In Addition, evidence from the literature Suggests That SZ and BD Patients share a profile like cognitive impairment With different degrees of deficits. THEREFORE, the Difference between the two groups to be more quantitative Seems (degree of deficit) rather than qualitative (profile) supporting a two dimensional approach to the clinical entities. Limitations of the present review includes the impossibility to check for effects of medication, time required for assessment varying across studies, reliability illness diagnosis, course and severity. Conclusion: Patients With BD to exhibit cognitive impairment Might That Could be similar to SZ in terms of their profile, SZ, Although With Patients May Have More Severe and Widespread impairments. © 2 Vöhringer, Barroilhet, Amerio, Reale, Alvear, Vergne and Ghaemi.;FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY;2013;Artículo;Psychiatry;0;cognit;deficit;impair;profil;comparison;;0;0;0;12;6;12;10;12;39
204;541;Incidence of subarachnoid haemorrhage in the Aconcagua Valley, Chile: a community-based, prospective surveillance project;Background: An epidemiological surveillance project was set-up in Central Chile to detect cases of subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) and STI incidence. Methods: Community-based prospective surveillance project Carried out Between 1 July 2000 and 30 June 2003, in the Aconcagua Valley in Central Chile. The authors ascertained all possible cases using multiple overlapping sources. Incidence rates Were age - sex-adjusted. Results: The authors first-ever Identified 33 cases Were 19 women. The mean age (SD, range) was 50.7 (17.9, 16 to 82). The incidence per 100,000 age - sex adjusted to the world population was 5.1 (4.4 men, women 5.6). The 30-day case-death rate was 54.5% (95% CI 38.0 to 70.2), and the death rate 21.2% prehospital (95% CI 10.7 to 37.7). Conclusions: The incidence rate in Aconcagua is notably to like in Northern Previously Reported That Chile and lower than in many high-income western Populations. The lower incidence rates found in two Chilean These Might be due to Populations Their younger age.

205;654;Fluoxetine response in impulsive-aggressive behavior and serotonin transporter polymorphism in personality disorder;Background: Central Disturbances in serotonin function in Impulsive Have Been Implicated and aggressive behavior. A deletion / insertion polymorphism Within the 5-HT transporter gene promoter (5-HTTLPR) is thought to be associated With disturbed impulse control, anxiety, and depression. The serotonin transporter (5-HTT) is the primary action site for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Several studies of major depression Have Shown That the l allele of 5-HTTLPR is associated With SSRI antidepressant effects better than the s allele. Methods: This study investigates the association of impulsivity Between response to treatment With fluoxetine and 5-HTTLPR polymorphism in 49 personality disordered patients. Additionally, we Studied TPH1, 5HT1B and 5HT2C receptor polymorphisms as predictors of response in esta population. Results: Results Reveal That Patients With the l / l genotype of 5-HTTLPR had a Significantly better response to fluoxetine When Compared to s allele carriers, as EVALUATED on the basis of the total (P <0.05) and Aggression subscale (P <0.01) Overt Aggression Scale Modified-score percentage change. There Were no significant associations Between response and TPH1 fluoxetine (A218C) (-6525 A> G) (-5806 G> T), HTR1B (G861C) and HTR2C (G68C) genotype groups. Conclusion: This is the first study Assessing the Association Between These polymorphisms and anti-impulsive response to fluoxetine in personality disorder. As the s genotype is associated with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors Poorer response in major depression, bulimia nervosa and borderline personality disorder, it Could Represent a common biological background for SSRI response. © 2 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.;PSYCHIATRIC GENETICS;2010;Artículo;Psychiatry;0;respons;fluoxetin;httlpr;impuls;polymorph;;0;0;0;12;6;19;8;20;38

Neural stem / progenitor cell cultures (cells neurosphere-derived) from olfactory mucosa of schizophrenia Patients Have Significantly dysregulated expression of genes in focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling, a key pathway regulating cell adhesion and migration. The aim was to study de este investigate Whether neurosphere-derived cells olfactory from schizophrenia Patients Have altered cell adhesion, cell motility, and focal adhesion dynamics. Methods: Olfactory neurosphere-derived cells from nine male and nine male schizophrenia Patients healthy subjects Control Were used. Were Cells Assayed for cell adhesion and cell motility and Analyzed for integrins and FAK proteins. Focal adhesions and Counted Were Measured in fixed cells, and time-lapse imaging was used to ASSESS cell motility and focal adhesion dynamics. Results: Patient-derived cells Were less adhesive and more motile than cells derived from healthy subjects control and Their motility was reduced to levels by controlling cell integrin-blocking antibodies and by inhibition of FAK. Vinculin-stained focal adhesion complexes Were Significantly smaller and fewer in patient cells. Time-lapse imaging of cells expressing FAK tagged with green fluorescent protein revealed That the disassembly of focal adhesions was Significantly faster in patient cells. Conclusions: The evidence for altered motility and focal adhesion dynamics in patient-derived cells is dysregulated gene expression consistent With the FAK signaling pathway in In These cells.

207;780;Relationship of cortisol levels and genetic polymorphisms to antidepressant response to placebo and fluoxetine in patients with major depressive disorder: a prospective study;Background: Increased cortisol levels and genetic polymorphisms Both Have Been related to major depressive disorder and antidepressant treatment outcome. The aim of esta study is to Evaluate the Relationship Between circadian salivary cortisol levels, cortisol suppression by dexamethasone and genetic polymorphisms in some genes HPA axis-related to the response to placebo and fluoxetine in depressed patients.Methods: The diagnosis and severity of depression Were performed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D17), respectively. Euthyroid Patients Treated With Were placebo (one week) followed by fluoxetine (20 mg) (two months). Severity of depression was re-EVALUATED after placebo, three weeks and two months of fluoxetine treatments. Placebo response was defined as HAM-D17 score reductions of at Least 25% and to & lt 15. Early response and response Were reductions of 50% At least three weeks after two months and, and remission With = 7 after two months. Plasma TSH, free T4, circadian salivary cortisol levels and cortisol suppression by dexamethasone Were EVALUATED. Seven genetic polymorphisms located in the Corticotrophin-releasing-hormone-receptor-1 (rs242939, rs242941, rs1876828), Corticotrophin-releasing-hormone-receptor-2 (rs2270007), Glucocorticoid-receptor (rs41423247), FK506-binding-protein-5 (rs1360780), and Arginine-vasopressin (rs3729965) genes Were determined. Analyzes Association Between response to placebo / fluoxetine and polymorphism Were performed by chi-square or Fisher exact test. Cortisol levels Were Compared by t-test, ANOVA and linear model for the overall Repeated measures.Results: 208 Patients Were Recruited depressed, 187 of Whom Were euthyroid. Placebo responders, fluoxetine responders and remitters exhibited Significantly lower cortisol levels than circadian did not respond Those Who (p-values <U+200B><U+200B>of 0.014, 0.008 and 0.021 respectively). Patients WHO abandoned before the third week treatment Also exhibited a trend to low cortisol levels (p = 0.057). The polymorphisms rs242939 (CRHR1) and rs2270007 (CRHR2) Were not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Only the rs242939 polymorphism (CRHR1) exhibited association with early response (three weeks) to fluoxetine (p-value = 0.043). No other association Between outcomes and polymorphisms was observed.Conclusions: These results support the clinical relevance of low salivary cortisol levels as a predictor of antidepressant response, or to placebo Either to fluoxetine. Only one polymorphism in the gene was associated CRHR1 With the early response. Other factors May be Involved in antidepressant response, further studies are needed, Although to Identify them. © 2014 Ventura-Junca et al., Licensee BioMed Central Ltd.;BMC PSYCHIATRY;2014;Artículo;Psychiatry;0;cortisol;respons;polymorph;fluoxetin;placebo;;0;0;0;13;6;19;10;20;14
208;869;Solving the Antidepressant Efficacy Question: Effect Sizes in Major Depressive Disorder;Background: Numerous reviews and meta-analyzes of the antidepressant literature in major depressive disorders (MDD), Both acute and maintenance, Have Been published, some claiming That Antidepressants are mostly ineffective and others That They are mostly effective, in Either acute or maintenance treatment . Objective: The Aims of esta study Were to review and critique the latest and MOST remarkable antidepressant MDD studies and to conduct our own reanalysis of the US Food and Drug Administration database studies Analyzed by Kirsch Specifically et al. Methods: We Gathered effect estimates of each MDD study. In our reanalysis of the acute depression studies, we corrected statistical analyzes for a floor effect so That relative (Instead of absolute) Differences Were Calculated effect size. We Also critiqued a recent meta-analysis of the literature maintenance treatment. Results: Our reanalysis Showed That antidepressant is seen not only benefit in severe depression but Also in moderate depression and confirmed a lack of benefit for antidepressants over placebo in mild depression. Relative antidepressant versus placebo benefit from 5% Increased linearly in mild depression to 12% in moderate depression to 16% in severe depression. The Claim That Antidepressants are completely ineffective, or even harmful, in maintenance treatment studies Involves unawareness of the enriched design effect, Which, in That analysis, was used to analyze placebo efficacy. The same problem exists for the standard interpretation of Those studies, they do not prove, Although They antidepressant efficacy Either, since They are biased in behalf of Antidepressants. Conclusions: In sum, we are close up commercial That antidepressants effective in acute depressive episodes are moderate to severe That but are not effective in mild depression. Except for the mildest depressive episodes, correction for the statistical effect floor Proves That Antidepressants are effective acutely. These considerations apply only to acute depression, however. For maintenance, the long-term efficacy of antidepressants is unproven, but the data do not support the Conclusion That They are harmful. © 2011 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.;CLINICAL THERAPEUTICS;2011;Artículo;Psychiatry;0;antidepress;depress;acut;mainten;analyz;;0;0;0;14;2;12;10;12;37
209;1160;Executive attention impairment in first-episode schizophrenia;Background: We Compared the attention abilities of a group of first-episode schizophrenia (FES) Patients and a group of healthy participants using the Attention Network Test (ANT), a procedure standard That estimates the functional state of three neural networks controlling the efficiency of three different attentional behaviors, ie, alerting (Achieving and Maintaining a state of high sensitivity to incoming stimuli), orienting (ability to select information from sensory input), and executive attention (Mechanisms for resolving conflict Among thoughts, feelings, and actions). Methods: We EVALUATED 22 FES Patients from 17 to 29 years of age with a recent history of a psychotic single episode Treated only with atypical neuroleptics, and 20 healthy persons matched with FES Patients by sex, age, and educational level as the Control group. Attention was using the ANT Estimated participants in Which Indicate Whether a central horizontal arrow is pointing to the left or the right. The arrow Central May be Preceded by spatial or temporal cues denoting the arrow Where and When Will Appear, and may be flanked by other arrows (hereafter, flankers) pointing in the same or the opposite direction.Results: The efficiency of the alerting, orienting , and executive networks was by measuring how Estimated reaction time was influenced by temporal congruency between, space, and flanker cues. We found That the Control group only Demonstrated Significantly greater efficiency than attention FES Patients in the executive attention network.Conclusions: FES Patients are impaired in executive attention but not in alerting or orienting attention, suggesting That May be executive attention deficit to primary impairment During The progression of the disease. © 2012 Orellana et al . licensee BioMed Central Ltd.;BMC PSYCHIATRY;2012;Artículo;Psychiatry;0;attent;execut;fes;arrow;alert;;0;0;0;3;6;12;10;12;40
210;1325;Development of community care for people with schizophrenia in chile;Greatly Chile has reformed approach to psychiatric care STI in the last two Decades, Having transitioned from a model centered around a psychiatric hospital to one in Which is based mental health care in the community. During esta period, Patients Were Moved from large psychiatric hospitals into ambulatory clinics, and the number of People Who Were in hospitals for extended periods Decreased. At the same time, mental health service networks-Consisting of ambulatory clinics, day hospitals, rehabilitation centers, group homes and community-were created, each responsible for a specific population. The reform process, however, has occurred in different, unequal degrees Throughout the country. The purpose of this investigation is to compare the Characteristics, resources, and results of the mental health service networks successfully transitioned to Have That and developed in the Community with respect to Those That are still centered in a hospital. The structural aspects Were EVALUATED With the EvaRedCom-TMS (Community Network Assessment Services Severe Mental Illness), and the level of Functioning was Measured With World Health Organization's International Classification of Mental Health Care. Area Networks With higher levels of community-based services show better indicators of geographic and financial accessibility, use less human resources (Particularly Psychiatrists and nursing assistants), have an equal level of specialization, and yet show better treatment adherence Among the Patients (84.2 percent versus 41.8 percent), Despite The Fact That Patients Have the socioeconomic and clinical indicators worse than area networks With lower levels of community-based services. In conclusion, the community-based psychiatric care model is more effective than the hospital-centered model. © 2012 M.E. Sharpe, Inc.

212;1484;Serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor and glucocorticoid receptor levels in lymphocytes as markers of antidepressant response in major depressive patients: A pilot study;Depressive Patients Often Have altered cortisol secretion, an effect likely That Derives from impaired activity of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), the main regulator of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Glucocorticoids reduce the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a downstream target of Antidepressants. Antidepressants Promote the activity of transcriptional cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element binding protein (CREB), a regulator of BDNF expression. To Identify potential biomarkers for the onset of antidepressant action in depressive Patients, and phospho-CREB GR (pCREB) levels in lymphocytes and serum BDNF levels Were During the course Repeatedly Measured of antidepressant treatment. Thirty-four depressed outpatients (10 male and 24 female) Were Treated With venlafaxine (75 mg / day), and 50% Individuals exhibiting a reduction in Their baseline 17-Item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score by the 6th week of treatment Were Considered responders. Responders Showed an early improvement in parallel with a rise in BDNF levels During the first two weeks of treatment. Non-responders GR Showed Increased levels by the third week and reduced serum BDNF by the sixth week of treatment. In contrast, venlafaxine did not Affect levels of pCREB. We close up commercial levels of BDNF That in serum and GR levels in lymphocytes May Represent Biomarkers That Could be used to predict responses to venlafaxine treatment. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.;PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH;2011;Artículo;Psychiatry;0;bdnf;treatment;antidepress;depress;week;treatment;68;9;0.0150842945874002;13;2;12;9;19;14

214;1924;Psychiatric Hospital Beds and Prison Populations in South America Since 1990 Does the Penrose Hypothesis Apply?;IMPORTANCE In 1939, Inglés mathematician, geneticist, and psychiatrist Lionel Penrose hypothesized That the numbers of psychiatric beds and the sizes of prison hospital Populations Were inversely related 75 years later, the question Arises as to Whether the hypothesis Applies to Recent Developments in South America. OBJECTIVE To explore the possible association of changes in the numbers of psychiatric hospital beds with changes in the sizes of Prison Populations in South America since 1990. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We searched the primary sources for numbers of psychiatric hospital beds in South American Countries since 1990 (the year the Latin American Countries That signed the Caracas Declaration) and against the changes These Compared sizes of Prison Populations. The associations Between the numbers of psychiatric beds and the sizes of Prison Populations Were tested using fixed-effects regression of panel data. Economic variables as covariates Were Considered. Sufficiently reliable and complete data Were Obtained from six countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The numbers of psychiatric beds and the sizes of Prison Populations. RESULTS Since 1990, the numbers of psychiatric beds in all 6 Decreased countries (ranging from -2.0% to -71.9%), while the sizes of prison Substantially Increased Populations (ranging from 16.1% to 273.0%). Panel data regression analysis across the 6 Countries Showed a significant inverse relationship Between numbers of psychiatric beds and sizes of Prison Populations. On average, the removal of 1 bed was associated With more prisoners 5.18 (95% CI, 3.10-7.26 P = .001), Which was reduced to 2.78 prisoners (95% CI, 2.59-2.97 P <.001) When economic growth was as a covariate Considered. The association Between the Numbers of psychiatric beds and the sizes of prison Populations Remained unchanged Practically When income inequality as a covariate was Considered (-4.28 [95% CI, -5.21 to -3.36] P <.001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Since 1990, the numbers of psychiatric beds Substantially Have Decreased in South America, while the sizes of the Prison Populations against a background Have Increased economic growth of strong. The Changes Appear to be associated Because the numbers of beds Decreased more extensively When and where the sizes of prison Increased Populations. These findings are consistent With and specify the assumption of an association Between the numbers of psychiatric beds and the sizes of Prison Populations. More research is needed to Understand the drivers of the Capacities of psychiatric hospitals and prisons and to explore Reasons for Their association.;JAMA PSYCHIATRY;2015;Artículo;Psychiatry;0;prison;bed;number;popul;psychiatr;;0;0;0;12;6;12;1;10;3

216;2035;Structural synaptic elements are differentially regulated in superior temporal cortex of schizophrenia patients;Inaccurate wiring and synaptic pathology Appear to be major hallmarks of schizophrenia. A variety of gene products in synaptic neurotransmission and Involved receptor signaling are differentially Expressed in brains of schizophrenia patients. However, Synaptic pathology May Also Develop by improper expression of intra- and extracellular structural elements synaptic weakening stability. THEREFORE, We Have Investigated transcription of These elements in the superior temporal gyrus left of 10 schizophrenia and 10 healthy controls Patients by genome-wide microarrays (Illumina). Fourteen up-regulated and 22 downregulated genes encoding structural elements Were Chosen from the lists of differentially regulated genes for further analysis QRTPCR. Almost all genes confirmed by esta method Were downregulated. Their gene products associated proteins Belonged to vesicle-, That is, synaptotagmin syntaxin 6 and 12 to cytoskeletal proteins, like myosin 6, pleckstrin, or to proteins of the extracellular matrix, collagens Such as, or laminin C3. Our results underline the pivotal roles of structural genes controlling formation and stabilization That of preand post-synaptic elements or axon guidance influence in schizophrenia.

223;2982;Regulation of immune-modulatory genes in left superior temporal cortex of schizophrenia patients: a genome-wide microarray study;Objectives. The role of neuroinflammation in schizophrenia has-been an issue for long time. There are reports supporting the hypothesis of ongoing inflammation and others denying it. This May be partly ascribed to the origin of the materials (CSF, blood, brain tissue) or to the genes selected for the respective studies. , Moreover, in some locations, inflammatory genes May be up-regulated, others May be down-regulated. Methods. Genome-wide microarrays used for expression Have Been profiling in postmortem brains of schizophrenia patients. Array data Have Been Analyzed by gene September enrichment analysis (GSEA) and further confirmed With selected genes by Real-Time PCR. Results. In Brodmann Area 22 of left superior temporal cortex, At least 70 genes (19%) out of 369 down-regulated genes (P <0.05) Belonged to the immune system. Those genes from 23 to 70 randomly selected Were Real-time PCR for. Six Reached significance level at P <0.05. Conclusions. The present data support a brain-specific view of the role immune-modulatory genes play in the May left superior temporal cortex in schizophrenia, Because the immune functions in Patients are not disturbed.

The purpose of this study was to ASSESS social Which Were Characteristics Associated With Psychological distress Within a disadvantaged, multi-ethnic neighborhood of Berlin. Methods: The study was Conducted in an area of <U+200B><U+200B>Berlin With the highest rates of unemployment and highest density of migrants. A Total of 143 participants aged 18-57 years Were included from a random sample. The Social Characteristics educational level, employment status, marital status, living alone, per-capita income and background of migration Were Collected. Psychological distress was Assessed using the General Health Questionnaire GHQ-28 Indicated scores = 5 psychological distress Corresponding to psychiatric caseness. Results: Psychological distress was found in 40.6% (n = 58) of the sample. Psychological distress was associated With age younger (OR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.92 to 0.98, p = 0.004), female gender (OR = 3.51, 95% CI = 1.55-7.92, p = 0.003) and living alone ( oR = 3.88, 95% CI = 1.58-9.52, p = 0.003), but not with background of migration, low educational level or With unemployment. Conclusions: Young age and female gender May predispose for psychological distress in disadvantaged areas.

This article Proposes a clinical description for defining MXD, Which emphasizes psychomotor excitation. Methods: Two hundred and nineteen consecutive outpatients diagnosed Were With An MXD episode using criteria Proposed by Koukopoulos et al. [Acta Psychiatr Scand 2007 115 (suppl 433): 50-57] we here report Their clinical features and antidepressant-related effects. Results: The most frequent MXD symptoms Were: psychic agitation or inner stress (97%), absence of retardation (82%), dramatic description of suffering or weeping spells (53%), talkativeness (49%), and racing or crowded thoughts (48%). With MXD was associated antidepressants in 50.7% of Patients, with a similar frequency for tricyclic antidepressants (45%) versus selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (38.5%). Positive predictors of antidepressant-associated bipolar disorder Were MXD type II diagnosis, higher depression severity index, and higher age at index episode. Antipsychotic or no treatment was protective against antidepressant-associated MXD. Conclusions: MXD, defined as excitatory With depression symptoms, can be clinically Identified, is common, OCCURS in unipolar depression and bipolar Both disorder, and is associated With antidepressant use Frequently. If replicated, this view of MXD Could be Considered a valid alternative to the DSM-5 criteria for depression With mixed features. © 2014 S.

Participants: 25 adolescents at the age of ADOPTED 6 months or older and 25 non-ADOPTED adolescents. Results: No significant Differences Were found in terms of groups Between behavioral problems. Adolescents at a later age ADOPTED presented more \social problems\"" than Those Who Were ADOPTED Earlier on. Even though the adolescents presented more ADOPTED insecure attachment, There Were no significant Differences Between groups in terms of behavioral problems and attachment style. There was a significant interaction Between adoption and attachment on the Thought Problems of the YSR scale, with the non-ADOPTED / insecure adolescents scoring higher. Possible interpretations of These results are presented in the discussion.

198;2992;Detecting Mood Disorder in Resource-Limited Primary Care Settings: Comparison of a self-administered screening tool to general practitioner assessment;Objectives: efficacious treatments, Although are available for mood disorders in primary care, under-diagnosis is associated With Poorer under-treatment and outcomes. This study compares the accuracy of screening tests self-administered With routine general practitioner (GP) assessment for detection of current mood disorder. Methods: 197 consecutive Patients attending primary care centers in Santiago, Chile Enrolled In This cross-sectional study, filling out the Patients Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) for depression and the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) for bipolar disorder, after routine GP assessment. Diagnostic accuracy of These tools was self-administered GP Compared With assessment, with gold standard diagnosis established by a structured diagnostic interview With trained clinicians (SCID-I). Results: The sample was 75% female, with a mean age of 48.5 (SD 16.8) 37% had a current mood disorder (SCID-I positive result for depression or bipolar disorder). Sensitivity of the screening instruments (SI) was Substantially higher than GP assessment (SI: 0.8 [95% CI 0.71, 0.81], versus GP: 0.2 [95% CI 0.12, 0.25]: p-value <0.0001), without sacrifice in specificity (SI: 0.9 [95% CI 0.86, 0.96], versus GP: 0.9 [95% CI 0.88, 0.97]: 01.04 p-value 0.7). This led to improvement in Both positive predictive value (SI: 0.8 [95% CI 0.82, 0.90], versus GP: 0.6 [95% CI 0.50, 0.64]: p-value <0.001) and negative predictive value (SI: 0.9 [95% CI 0.78, 0.91] versus GP: 0.7 [95% CI 0.56, 0.72]: p-value <0.01). Conclusion: Self-administered screening tools are more accurate than current detecting GP assessment in mood disorder in low-income primary care.

In Chile sustained in the presence of Increase obesity and excess weight in children Has Been Observed. However, the amount and the dynamics of the aforementioned problematic eating Behaviors in Chilean children are unknown. The aim of study was to esta ASSESS the relationship Between restrained, external, and emotional eating, and variations in body mass index (BMI) in Chilean children. Consequently, 453 children from 7 to 12 years of age Responded to the Children's Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire, Spanish version. In Addition, Their anthropometric data Were Obtained. A positive association was found Between eating and BMI restrained, and a negative correlation Between external eating and BMI. Emotional eating a modest inverse relationship Demonstrated With BMI. A significant interaction Between Behavior and nutritional status problematic (normal-weight, overweight, obese) was revealed. Restrained eating was characteristic of obese children eating of external Whereas the normal-weight children.

162;287;Strong responsiveness to noise interference in an anuran from the southern temperate forest;Animals adopt different strategies to communicate by Means of sound in noisy environments. Some animals Increase, while others decrease, Their voice activity in the presence of interference. Anuran amphibians from diverse latitudes exhibit Both kinds of responses. Recent studies Have Shown That evils of Batrachyla taeniata and Batrachyla antartandica from the southern temperate forest do not call in response to the presentation of advertisement calls of sympatric congeneric species, but Their responsiveness to other kinds of interference has not Been tested. To explore the diversity in responsiveness to acoustic intrusion in a single species, we evils of B. taeniata exposed to prolonged abiotic Natural prerecorded noises of wind, creek, and rain and to a band-pass noise centered at 2,000 Hz, at 67 dB sound pressure level (SPL). The subjects drastically Increased Their call rate When all four exposed to sounds. Frogs Present Responded voice activity by augmenting Their to exposures of band-pass noise at increase increasing intensities (55-79 dB SPL). The Increase in voice activity in response to noise is strong relative to other Those of anurans from the temperate forest Studied Previously under a similar exposures. These results reveal a remarkable activation of voice response to abiotic acoustic interference of continuous noise, Which would allow compensating for limitations in the space under active communication background sounds.

These Could be related to the distribution of cardiovascular risk factors, the quality of medical care or socioeconomic status Influencing incidence or case fatality rates. Our objective was to investigate variables explaining the variability in stroke mortality rates in the different regions of Chile. Methods: Adjusted mortality rates stroke in different regions Were Calculated for the year 2003. Variables Were added from three sources: the National Death Certificate Database, the National Socioeconomic Characterization Survey and the National Health Survey. A logistic regression model was used to investigate regions, demographic variables and socioeconomic variables associated With the risk of death from stroke. A linear regression model was used to study the association of socioeconomic variables and cardiovascular risk factors With the standardized mortality rate by region and the contribution of These to the variability. Results: A Twofold Increase was found in mortality rates adjusted stroke Among regions. Greater risk was associated with older age, female gender and residence in regions V, VII, VIII and IX. Sixty-two percent of the regional rate variability was combined Explained by the prevalence of poverty (34%), diabetes (17%), sedentarism (8%) and overweight (3%). Conclusion: The risk of death from stroke in Chile is associated with age, sex and living in four specific regions of the country.

It Has Been Proposed That esta behavior is a self-organized process. However, to prove self-organization, it is Necessary to study the dynamics of huddling, ruling out the presence of leaders. The Objectives of esta Were study to determine the dynamics of huddling at different temperatures in Octodon degus, documenting the presence or absence of leaders, and to study the consistency of esta behavior in two contrasting seasons. We found huddling That did not Indicate the dynamics presence of leader Initiators of the clustering at lower temperatures. There was no pattern in huddling deterministic dynamics, in any period or at any temperature, suggesting a spontaneously without any behavior triggered order, hierarchy, or recipes. The effect of temperature on huddling behavior was marked and the like in Both seasons. The variability of the huddled groups was greater at higher temperatures, Which is Explained by a greater movement of Individuals and more frequent variations in the number and size of the groups at higher temperatures.

170;2204;The effect of paraoxon on spermatogenesis in Dugesia gonocephala from the Chilean Altiplano: proliferation and apoptosis;Introduction and AIMS: The Chilean Altiplano ecosystem is conserved free from contaminants and pollutants Because of the absence of the local major human activities: such as agriculture or other industries. We Studied the effects of paraoxon on proliferation and apoptosis of testicular cells During active spermatogenesis in Dugesia gonocephala Collected from a pristine river (Guacollo) in the Altiplano region Visviri nearby town, Chile. Materials and methods: Adult planarians Were incubated in varying Concentrations of paraoxon (0.8, 0.4, 0.04, 0.004, and 0.0004 mM) for 4 h. After 3 h of incubation, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was added. Effects on cell proliferation (BrdU) and apoptosis (Apaf-1) Were Determined by immunohistochemistry. Results: Concentrations of 0.4 and Paraoxon 0.8 mM 100% mortality Caused in the respective treatment groups. The lowest concentration tested (0.0004 mM) Caused a significant Increase on cell proliferation in the seminiferous tubules, as well as an Increase in the number of apoptotic cells. All other tested inhibited cell proliferation Significantly Concentrations and induced apoptosis.

172;2924;Peripheral and Central Auditory Dysfunction Induced by Occupational Exposure to Organic Solvents;OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of solvent exposure on hearing function, through an audiological test battery, in a population not occupationally exposed to high levels of noise. METHODS: One hundred ten workers from a factory coating Were Studied. Jobs at the factory Were divided into three different levels of solvent exposure. Hearing status was Assessed with a test battery Including pure-tone thresholds hearing (0.5-8 kHz), high-frequency hearing thresholds (12 and 16 kHz), and dichotic listening test Measured through dichotic digits. Multiple linear regression models Were created to explore possible association Between each solvent exposure and outcomes of the hearing. RESULTS: Significant associations Between the three solvent exposure and hearing outcomes were found. Such covariates as age, gender, race, and ethnicity Were Also Significantly Associated With the Studied hearing outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Occupational exposure to solvents May induces Both peripheral and central auditory dysfunction. The dichotic digits test as a sensitive tool Seems to detect the central auditory dysfunction associated With solvent exposure. Hearing loss prevention programs May Use this tool to monitor hearing in solvent-exposed workers.

173;3129;Changes to indoor air quality as a result of relocating families from slums to public housing;Largely unstudied One benefit of relocating families from slums to public housing is the potential improvement in indoor air quality (IAQ). We Compared Families That Moved from slums to public housing With That Remained Those living in slums in Santiago, Chile in terms of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) as main indicator of change. A cross-sectional study of 98 families relocated and 71 still living in slums was Carried out, indoor and outdoor Obtaining samples by a Personal Environmental Monitor. Home Characteristics, Including indoor air pollution sources Were Collected through questionnaires. Multivariate regression models included the intervention (public housing or slum), indoor pollution sources, outdoor PM2.5 and family características as predictors. Indoor PM2.5 Concentrations Were higher in slum (77.8 mg m-3 [SD = 35.7 mg m-3]) than in public housing (55.7 mg m-3 [SD = 34.6 mg m-3], p & lt .001) . Differences Between indoor and outdoor PM2.5 significant only in the Were slum houses. The multivariate analysis Showed That Significantly Decreased indoor housing intervention PM2.5 (10.4 mg m-3) after adjusting by the other predictors. Outdoor PM2.5 was the main predictor of indoor PM2.5. Other significant factors Were water heating fuels and indoor smoking. Having infants 1-23 months was associated with a lowering of indoor PM2.5. Our results Suggest That a public housing program That Moves families from slum to public housing Improves indoor air quality through Directly and Indirectly Present air pollution sources. © 2 Elsevier Ltd.;ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT;2013;Artículo;Public, enviromental & occupational health;0;indoor;hous;slum;public;famili;;0;0;0;12;6;12;1;10;22

Whether we tested make use of human observers Differences Between power spectral image categories When detecting animals in a natural scenes. In Experiments 1 and 2 we found performance to be independent of the power Essentially spectrum. Computational analysis revealed the ease of classification That Correlates With the Proposed spectral cue without being Caused by it. This result is consistent With the hypothesis That in commercial stock photo databases a majority of the animal images are pre-segmented from the background by the photographers and esta pre-segmentation causes the power spectral Differences Between image categories and may, furthermore, help rapid Animal Detection . Data from a third experiment are consistent With This hypothesis. Together, our results make it exceedingly unlikely That make use of human observers power spectral Differences Between animal- and non-animal images animals During rapid detection.

Perfusion summed stress scores (SSS) different from correlation processing Modalities versus non-corrected studies differed Significantly independent of the degree of motion. Mean SSS in 40 Patients With No motion was 3.9<U+2208> ± <U+2208>3.9 When no correction was applied With automatic correction was 8.8<U+2208> ± <U+2208>10 (p<U+2208> = <U+2208>0.03) and With Manual correction was 3.1<U+2208> ± <U+2208>3.5 (p<U+2208> = <U+2208>ns versus non-corrected). Automatic correction was better When applied to Patients With Mild to moderate motion. In Those With mild or no motion, software overestimated or created new perfusion defects. Conclusion: Motion-correction software must be used with caution When trying to optimize myocardial perfusion SPECT based on single analysis. Acquisition Should be always Repeated in severe cases With motion and in no or mild motion to avoid it Seems preferable correction. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.;EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING;2010;Artículo;Radiology, nuclear medicine & medical imaging;0;correct;motion;perfus;â;softwar;;0;0;0;12;6;12;10;26;5

144;939;Impaired Immune Response in Severe Human Lower Tract Respiratory Infection by Respiratory Syncytial Virus;Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of acute lower respiratory infection in infants. The immune response plays a leading role in the severity of the disease. We hypothesized That severe RSV disease is associated With an impaired immune response Characterized by low circulating T lymphocytes and plasma Cytokine Concentrations. Methods: We evaluate- the in vivo immune responses of healthy infants with previously With Their first proven RSV-acute lower respiratory infection That required hospitalization. According To the clinical severity, defined by using a strict scoring system, the in vivo immune response was through the analysis of Compared plasma cytokine values <U+200B><U+200B>and the phenotyping of peripheral blood lymphocyte and natural killer (NK) cells. Results: Absolute blood cell counts of CD4 +, CD8 +, and CD19 + lymphocytes and NK cells in subjects Were lower than in infants RSV With control. Lowest infants cell counts Were Observed in more severe RSV-infected. Significant low values <U+200B><U+200B>Were Obtained in CD8 + lymphocytes (P = 0.03) and nonactive NK cells, express CD94 antigen That (P = 0.046). In contrast, activated NK cells express CD94 That do not Significantly higher Were molecules in RSV infected infants than in healthy controls (% of cells: P = 0.004). The interferon-<U+03B3> and tumor necrosis factor-a values <U+200B><U+200B>in RSV infected Patients Were lower than in controls subjects. Interleukin-17 cytokine was not detected in healthy infants and the largest concentration was found in moderately ill Patients With severe cases as Compared (P = 0.033). RSV infection Showed Significantly higher interleukin-8 chemokine in infants than control (P = 0.024). CONCLUSION :: We propose That severe RSV infection in very young infants is associated with poor blood proinflammatory cytokine production, low counts of CD8 + T cells and with a greater activity of a group of NK cells, That are independent of the major histocompatibility complex class Ib recognition system.

147;1104;Frequency and Clinical Outcome of Respiratory Viral Infections and Mixed Viral-bacterial Infections in Children With Cancer, Fever and Neutropenia;Background: The role of viral respiratory infections (RVIS) as a cause of fever and neutropenia overall (FN) episodes in children with Cancer Has Been Characterized less than bacterial infections. We Conducted a study to determine the frequency Aimed of RVI in Children with low Compared With high risk for invasive bacterial infection (IBI) FN episodes and compare the clinical outcome of RVI and mixed RV-bacterial infections. Methods: Prospective, Multicenter Study in Children with cancer and FN ADMITTED to pediatric hospitals in Chile Between May 2009 and January 2011. Children Were EVALUATED by clinical examination and laboratory tests, bacterial cultures and Their Including risk for IBI. Nasopharyngeal sample was Obtained for the detection of 17 respiratory viruses using polymerase chain reaction-DNA microarray platform. Results: A total number of 331 episodes of FN in 193 children enrolled Were of Whom 55% Were male, with the median age of 7 years and 61% had a hematological malignancy. A viral and / or bacterial pathogen was detected in 67% (224/331) episodes. Overall, RVIS Were associated With 57% of FN of Which one-third Were mixed RV-bacterial infections. Bacterial infection was detected in 29% (97/331). Children classified as high risk at admission for IBI had a similarly overall proportion of RVI Compared With low-risk group. Respiratory syncytial virus (31%) and rhinovirus (23%) Were the detected respiratory viruses Most Frequently, followed by parainfluenza (12%) and influenza A (11%). Children detected With any respiratory virus ADH fewer days of hospitalization and a Significantly lower probability of hypotension and admission to pediatric intensive care unit irrespective of Their risk classification status at admission When Compared with children With mixed RV-bacterial bacterial or infections (P <0.05) . All children with a positive outcome HAD sole RVI. Conclusions: RVIS Were the Most Frequently detected irrespective of agents Their initial risk assessment for IBI. The clinical outcome of mixed RVI RVI was similar to sole as well as episodes for bacterial infections Compared With mixed viral-bacterial infections. Systematic and early detection of RVI in Children with cancer and FN Might help to optimize Their management by reducing hospitalization and antimicrobial use. © 2012 by Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.;PEDIATRIC INFECTIOUS DISEASE JOURNAL;2012;Artículo;Respiratory system;0;bacteri;children;infect;rvi;risk;children;177;0;0.0392635314995563;9;8;9;5;1;42

122;266;Trehalose delays the progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis by enhancing autophagy in motoneurons;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal disease motoneuron With no current effective treatment. Accumulation of abnormal SOD1 protein container containing inclusions, TARDBP, FUS, Among other proteins, is a pathological hallmark of ALS. Autophagy is the major degradation pathway Involved in the clearance of damaged organelles and protein aggregates. , Although autophagy has-been shown to degrade Efficiently ALS-linked mutant protein in cell culture models, Several studies autophagy impairment Suggest That May Also Contribute to disease pathogenesis. In This report, we tested the potential use of trehalose, a disaccharide That induces mTOR-independent autophagy, in the development of experimental ALS. Administration of trehalose to mutant SOD1 transgenic mice life span Significantly prolonged and attenuated the progression of disease signs. These effects Were Associated With Decreased accumulation of SOD1 aggregates and enhanced motoneuron survival. The protective effects of trehalose Were Associated With Increased autophagy levels in motoneurons. Cell culture experiments led to trehalose Demonstrated That mutant SOD1 degradation by autophagy in NSC34 motoneuron cells and primary motoneurons Also protected against the toxicity of mutant SOD1 conditioned medium from astrocytes transgenic. At the mechanistic level, trehalose treatment led to a significant upregulation in the expression of key autophagy-related genes at the mRNA level Including Lc3, Becn1, SQSTM1 and Atg5. Consistent With These changes, trehalose enhanced the administration of FOXO1 nuclear translocation, an Important transcription factor Involved in the activation of autophagy in neurons. This study Suggests a potential use of trehalose and enhancers of mTOR-independent autophagy for the treatment of ALS. © 2 Landes Bioscience.;AUTOPHAGY;2013;Artículo;Rheumatology;0;autophagi;trehalos;motoneuron;sod;mutant;;0;0;0;5;5;5;8;11;2

124;461;Discontinuation of tumour necrosis factor inhibitors in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in low-disease activity: persistent benefits. Data from the Corrona registry;Background There is Increasing interest in discontinuing biological therapies for Patients With rheumatoid arthritis (RA) Achieving good clinical responses, provided clinical benefit Patients Maintain. Methods Patients We Assessed With RA from the WHO Registry Corrona discontinued treatment tumor necrosis With Their first factor inhibitor (TNFi) while in low-disease activity (LDA) or lower levels of disease activity. They were followed Patients Until They lost clinical benefit, defined as disease Increased activity or change in RA medications. Duration of maintenance of clinical benefit was using the Estimated Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazard models Were Assessed to Identify factors related to maintenance of benefit. Results We Identified Patients With RA 717 eligible from 35,656 in the Corrona registry. At discontinuation, Patients had a median duration of RA 8 years, mean clinical disease activity score of 4.3 ± 0.11 Were using TNFi 41.8% as monotherapy. 73.4% of Patients maintained benefit for <12 months after discontinuing therapy and 42.2% did so through 24 months. Factors predictive of clinical benefit in Maintaining multivariate analysis included lower disease activity, less pain and better functional status at the time of TNFi discontinuation. Among 301 Patients initiating Their first TNFi Within the registry, faster responders (ie Those Who Achieved LDA in 4 months or less) did better than slower responders (HR 1.54 (95% CI 1.17 to 2.04)). RA disease duration did not Affect maintenance of clinical benefit. Conclusions Discontinuation of a first course of TNFi May be Associated With persistent clinical benefit. Half of Patients maintained through 20 months response. Several Characteristics May help predict patient benefit persistent. © 2014 BMJ Publishing Group Ltd & European League Against Rheumatism.;ANNALS OF THE RHEUMATIC DISEASES;2015;Artículo;Rheumatology;0;benefit;clinic;discontinu;activ;tnfi;activ;155;1;0.0343833185448092;8;8;12;10;14;25

126;1362;Weak CD4+ T-cell responses to citrullinated vimentin in rheumatoid arthritis patients carrying HLA-DR9 alleles;Citrullinated vimentin (cVIM) is one of the antigens targeted by anti-Specifically citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. The Association Between ACPA and HLA-DRB1 alleles Certain, for the coding Those shared epitope (SE) Suggests That esta response Could be T-cell mediated. HLA-DR9 alleles, Which do not code for the SE, have recently Been Associated With ACPA (+) RA. The objective of CD4 This work was to study T cell responses to + cVIM in RA Patients and healthy controls carrying HLA-DR9 alleles. Fourteen RA Patients and healthy controls with previously genotyped ten for HLA-DRB1 Were Studied for the presence of serum anti-cVIM antibodies by Western blot and ELISA. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated Were With native vimentin and cVIM, and CD4 + T cells proliferation was Assessed by flow cytometry. Citrulline-specific CD4 + T cells proliferation was found not only in RA Patients in healthy controls but Past. MOST, Although HLA-DR9 Patients carrying alleles present anti-cVIM antibodies, HLA-DR9 alleles CD4 Were associated With weaker cVIM-driven T-cell responses + Among RA patients. These results Suggest That HLA-DR9 alleles exert a protective effect Could on the recognition of epitopes cVIM by CD4 + T cells.

127;1831;Clinical and genetic features of hereditary periodic fever syndromes in Hispanic patients: the Chilean experience;Hereditary syndromes periodic fever (HPFS) are rare genetic diseases Characterized by recurrent episodes of inflammation. Little information is available in Latin American Concerning HPFS Hispanic population. The purpose of this study was to determine the clinical and genetic features of HPFS in Chilean population. A multicenter retrospective study of Hispanic Patients With Chilean genetically confirmed HPFS was performed. We included 13 Patients, 8 with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) and 5 with TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), EVALUATED at rheumatology clinics or pediatric rheumatology Between January 2007 and December 2. Median age onset of symptoms was 8 years (range 1-35) and 8 years (range 0.3 to 21) for FMF and TRAPS, respectively. Median duration of fever was 3 days (range 2.5-15) for FMF and 21 days (range 9.5-30) for TRAPS. Genotyping of the MEFV gene in FMF Patients revealed missense mutation M694V to homozygous in one patient, and heterozygous missense mutations in seven Patients: M694V (n = 3), E148Q, R717H, A744S, A511V and. Sequencing of the gene in TRAPS TNFRSF1A heterozygous missense mutations revealed Patients in four Patients: T50M, C30R, R92Q, and IVS3 + 30: G <U+2192> A, and a two-base pair deletion (IVS2-17-18del2bpCT) in one patient.

128;2741;Changes in Rab3D Expression and Distribution in the Acini of Sjogren's Syndrome Patients Are Associated With Loss of Cell Polarity and Secretory Dysfunction;Objective Oral and ocular dryness are frequent and serious symptoms of Sjögren's syndrome (SS) That Reflect problems in secretion due to glandular dysfunction. Exocytosis, an Important process in the secretory pathway, requires the participation of Rab GTPases family. This study was Undertaken to analyze the expression and localization of Rab3D and Rab8A and to examine Their Correlation With acinar cell polarity and glandular secretory function. Nineteen Methods Patients With SS and 17 controls Were EVALUATED. Levels of Rab3D and Rab8A messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein Were Determined by Real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. Subcellular localization of proteins by indirect immunofluorescence was determined to analysis. Results In Patients With SS, Rab3D Total protein levels Decreased Significantly, while mRNA levels Remained unchanged. For Rab8A, no changes in mRNA or protein levels Either Were detected. In serous acini of labial salivary glands from Patients With SS, the following four patterns of staining Were Rab3D distinguishable: Severely Decreased, distribution Throughout the cytoplasm, distribution Throughout the cytoplasm With combined loss of nuclear polarity, and the normal apical localization. Basal localization of Rab8A was not modified. Were changes Rab3D Accompanied by apicobasolateral redistribution of ezrin, loss of nuclear polarity, Thicker Golgi stacks, and mucin 7 accumulation in the cytoplasm. Finally, low protein levels correlated Rab3D With Alterations in scintigraphy measurements. Conclusion Our findings Indicate That Rab3D Regulates the exocytosis of many components critical for the maintenance of oral physiology. HENCE, the changes in Rab3D Observed expression and distribution are likely to Contribute to the decrease in or loss of components saliva (i.e., mucins), Which May Explain the variety of oral and ocular symptoms associated With SS.

129;2762;Rheumatoid Arthritis in Latin Americans Enriched for Amerindian Ancestry is Associated With Loci in Chromosomes 1, 12, and 13, and the HLA Class II Region;Objective To Identify susceptibility loci for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in Latin American and European admixed Individuals with genetic Amerindian ancestry. Methods Genotyping was performed in 1,475 Patients With RA and 1.213 subjects control using a customized container containing BeadArray 196.524 markers associated with previously loci covering various autoimmune diseases With. Principal components analysis (EigenSoft package) and Structure software used to identify identity Were outliers and define the population substructure. REAP software was used to define cryptic relatedness and duplicates, and genetic association analyzes using Plink Were Conducted statistical software. Results A strong genetic association Between RA and the major histocompatibility complex region was Observed, localized Within BTNL2 / DRA-DQB1- DQA2 (P = 7.6 × 10 -10) with 3 independent effects. We Identified an association in the PLCH2-HES5-TNFRSF14-MMEL1 region of chromosome 1 (P = 9.77 × 10 -6), Which was with previously reported almost in Europeans, Asians, and Native Canadians. We Identified putative novel one association in ENOX1 on chromosome 13 (P = 3.24 × 10-7). Previously Reported associations Were Observed in the current study, Including PTPN22, SPRED2, STAT4, IRF5, CCL21, and IL2RA, the significance was, Although Relatively moderate. Adjustment for the Amerindian ancestry improved association of a novel locus in chromosome 12 at C12orf30 (NAA25) (P = 3.9 × 10-6). Associations With the HLA region, SPRED2, and PTPN22 improved in Individuals positive for anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies. Conclusion Our data defines, for the first time, the contribution of Amerindian ancestry to the genetic architecture of RA in an admixed Latin American population by confirming the role of the HLA region and supporting the association with a locus in chromosome 1. In Addition, we Provide data for novel putative loci in chromosomes 12 and 13.

130;2772;Disruption of Tight Junction Structure in Salivary Glands From Sjogren's Syndrome Patients Is Linked to Proinflammatory Cytokine Exposure;Objective. Disorganization apical microvilli of acinar cell and the presence of stromal collagen in the acinar lumen Suggest That the labial salivary gland (LSG) barrier function is impaired in Patients With Sjögren's syndrome. Tight junctions define cell polarity and Regulate the paracellular flow of ions and water, crucial functions of acinar cells. This study was Undertaken to evaluate- the expression and localization of tight junction proteins in LSGS from Patients With SS and to determine in vitro the effects of tumor necrosis a factor (TNF) and interferon-<U+03B3> (IFN) on tight junction integrity of isolated acini from Control subjects. Methods. Twenty-two Patients Were Studied and 15 controls. The messenger RNA and protein levels of tight junction components (claudin-1, claudin-3, claudin-4, occludin, and ZO-1) Were Determined by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. Tight junction protein localization was Determined by immunohisto-chemistry. Tight junction ultrastructure was Examined by transmission electron microscopy. Control acini isolated from subjects Were Treated With TNFa and IFNy. Results. Significant Differences in tight junction protein levels detected in Patients With Were SS. Occludin and ZO-1 strongly down-regulated Were, while claudin-1 and claudin-4 Were overexpressed. Tight junction proteins localized to apical domains Exclusively in acini and ducts of LSGS from controls. In SS Patients, the occludin and ZO-1 apical domain the presence of Decreased, while claudin-3 and claudin-4 was redistributed to the basolateral plasma membrane. Exposure of isolated Control TNFa and IFNy acini to Alterations in vitro These reproduced. Ultrastructural analysis associated tight junction disorganization With the presence of endocytic vesicles container containing electron-dense materials That May Represent tight junction components. Conclusion. Our findings Indicate That Cytokine production premises in LSGS from SS Patients May Contribute to the secretory gland dysfunction in SS Patients Observed by altering tight junction integrity of epithelial cells, thereby decreasing the quality and quantity of saliva. © 2 American College of Rheumatology.;ARTHRITIS AND RHEUMATISM;2010;Artículo;Rheumatology;0;junction;tight;claudin;protein;acini;protein;107;5;0.0237355811889973;12;6;12;6;9;4

132;2798;Alterations in Type I Hemidesmosome Components Suggestive of Epigenetic Control in the Salivary Glands of Patients With Sjogren's Syndrome;Objective: Acinar cells in the salivary glands of Sjögren's syndrome Patients With (SS) display severe Alterations in Anchorage to the basal lamina. Bioinformatics analysis of the BP230 gene sequence has revealed the presence of CpG islands That Might Be Involved in Control of epigenetic gene expression, and methylation of the promoter region BP230 May be Implicated as an epigenetic mechanism in controlling salivary gland damage. THUS, the present study was to Evaluate the protein Undertaken BP230, BP180 as well as proteins, a6ß4 integrin, and cytokeratin-18, for Their expression levels, localization, and ability to form complexes hemidesmosome adhesion. Methods: Eighteen Patients With primary SS and 14 healthy subjects Were Studied Control. Levels of messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein Were Measured by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting, respectively. BP230 was determined to methylation by methylation-sensitive polymerase chain reaction. Protein complexes Were Analyzed by immunoprecipitation and Assessed for localization by immunofluorescence. Results: In Patients With SS as Compared With controls, BP230 Decreased mRNA levels Were Were Increased while protein levels, and the gene promoter region was hypermethylated. Augmented proteolysis of BP180 was detected, since levels of linear IgA disease fragment 1 Were Increased. The complex-forming ability of BP230, BP180, a6ß4 integrin, and cytokeratin-18 was maintained in Patients With SS, in contrast to controls That in. BP230 and BP180 colocalized at the basal membrane of acinar cells, and cleavage of BP180 coincided with a loss of colocalization. Conclusion: The decrease in mRNA levels BP230 May be Explained by gene hypermethylation. We postulate Local That epigenetic Modifications of BP230 are produced in response to factors present in the damaged salivary glands of Patients With SS. Additionally, the BP230 protein paradoxical Increase in levels and the formation of Both the normal and altered adhesion complexes May help avoid cell death induced by the loss of anchorage. © 2011 American College of Rheumatology.;ARTHRITIS AND RHEUMATISM;2011;Artículo;Rheumatology;0;protein;complex;gene;epigenet;gland;protein;107;5;0.0237355811889973;12;5;5;6;9;4
133;2816;Systemic lupus erythematosus impairs memory cognitive tests not affected by depression;Objective: Our aim was to ASSESS the contribution of depression to cognitive impairment in Patients With Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). Methods: Clinical features, education, age, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) Were EVALUATED in 82 Patients With SLE and healthy controls 22, all Chilean women. The Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB EclipseTM) Assessing attention, spatial memory, and learning and executive function domains was applied. Cognitive deficits definition: a cut-off was defined for definite impairment as a score below -2 standard deviations in one outcome At least two or more measure in domains. With ANCOVA stepwise selection EVALUATED influences of health status (SLE or control), age, education, and HADS depression and anxiety scores on cognitive outcomes. To avoid overfitting, a shrinkage method was performed. Also, adjusted p-values <U+200B><U+200B>for multiple comparisons Were Obtained. Results: Cognitive deficits AFFECTED 16 (20%) Patients, and no controls (p = 0.039). Median HADS depression score in SLE Patients was 6 (0-19 range) and in controls was 0 (0-19), p <0.001). ANCOVA models and shrinkage Showed That cognitive performance worse in sustained attention and spatial working memory tests was Explained by The Presence of SLE but not depression, depression Whereas only AFFECTED to measure of executive function (I / ED Stages completed). Conclusion: Depression has a limited role in cognitive impairment in SLE. Impairments in sustained attention and working memory space are distinctly influenced by yet-unknown disease-intrinsic factors. © The Author (s) 2014.;LUPUS;2014;Artículo;Rheumatology;0;depress;cognit;sle;impair;attent;;0;0;0;14;2;12;10;12;39

137;2972;An analysis of 372 patients with anterior uveitis in a large Ibero-American cohort of spondyloarthritis: the RESPONDIA Group;Objectives This study analysed the frequency of anterior uveitis (AU) and Its Correlations in a large cohort of Patients With spondyloarthritis (SpA). Methods A common protocol of investigation was prospectively applied to 2012 SpA Patients in 85 centers from 10 Ibero-American Countries. Clinical and demographic variables and disease indexes Were Investigated. Categorical variables Were Compared by? 2 and Fisher's exact test, and continuous variables by ANOVA or Were Compared Kruskal-Wallis test. A value of p <0.05 was significant Considered. Results AU 372 was Referred by SpA Patients (18.5%). AU was statistically associated With inflammatory low back pain (p <0.001), radiographic sacroiliitis (p <0.001), enthesopathies (p = 0.004), urethritis / acute diarrhea (p <0.001), balanitis (p = 0.002), hip Involvement ( p = 0.002), HLA-B27 (p = 0.003), and higher C-reactive protein (p = 0.001), Whilst it was negatively associated With the number of painful (p = 0.03) and swollen (p = 0.005) peripheral joints , psoriatic arthritis (p <0.001), psoriasis (p <0.001), nail Involvement (p <0.001), and dactilitis (p = 0.062 trend). No association with gender, race, and indices (disease activity, functionality and quality of life) was Observed. Logistic regression Showed That ankylosing spondylitis (p = 0.001) and HLA-B27 (p = 0.083 trend) was Significantly Associated With AU, while extra-articular manifestations (predominantly psoriasis) Were negatively associated (p = 0.016).

138;3022;Decreased salivary sulphotransferase activity correlated with inflammation and autoimmunity parameters in Sjogren's syndrome patients;Objectives: To determine the expression and enzymatic activities of sulphotransferases Involved in mucin hyposulphation in labial salivary glands (LSGS) from SS to correlate Patients and clinical parameters With sulphotransferase activity: such as secretion, inflammation and serology. Methods: LSG from SS 31 31 Patients and Control Subjects Studied Were. Relative mRNA and protein levels of Gal3-O-sulphotransferases (Gal3STs) and ß1,3-galactosyltransferase-5 (ß3GalT5) Were Determined by quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. Enzymatic activities using radioactively Quantified Were Labeled donor acceptor substrates and specific substrates. Products Were purified by chromatography. Spearman's correlation analysis was used to compare data. Results: The levels of activity Gal3ST Were Significantly Decreased in Patients SS, without changes in mRNA and protein levels, while the enzymatic activities of glycosyltransferases Were Involved in mucin-like glycosylation in Both groups. An inverse correlation was Observed Between Gal3ST activity and glandular function Measured by scintigraphy, but not unstimulated salivary flow With. Gal3ST activity was inversely correlated With focus score, TNF-a levels and presence of the autoantibodies Ro / SS-A and La / SS-B. Conclusion: The decrease in activity sulphotransferase Provides an explanation for mucin hyposulphation Observed in the LSGS from SS patients. The decrease in activity Gal3STs was not a consequence of reduced gene expression, but probably due to enzyme activity Alterations in the regulation. Interestingly, the levels of activity detected sulphotransferase Correlated Well with secretory function, inflammation and serology. Finally, we postulate pro-inflammatory cytokines That induced by autoantibodies,: such as Ro / SS-A and La / SS-B in SS Patients, may modulate Gal3ST activity, thereby altering mucin quality and leading to mouth dryness. © The Author 2011.

139;3218;Pathogenic role of BECN1/Beclin 1 in the development of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis;Pharmacological activation of autophagy is becoming an attractive strategy to induce the selective degradation of aggregate-prone proteins. Recent evidence Also Suggests That autophagy impairment underlie the pathogenesis of May Several neurodegenerative diseases. Mutations in the gene encoding SOD1 (superoxide disumutase 1) trigger familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), misfolding and aggregation inducing ITS and the progressive loss of motoneurons. It is still under discussion Whether autophagy has a protective or detrimental role in ALS. Here we Evaluate the impact of BECN1 / Beclin 1, an essential regulator autophagy, in ALS. Were BECN1 upregulated levels in cells and animals Both mutant SOD1 expressing. To Evaluate the impact of BECN1 to the pathogenesis of ALS in vivo, we generated mutant SOD1 transgenic mice heterozygous for Becn1. We Observed an unexpected life span Increase in mutant SOD1 transgenic mice of haploinsufficient for Becn1 Control Compared With littermate animals. These effects Were Accompanied by enhanced accumulation of SQSTM1 / p62 and LC3-reduced levels of II, and an altered monomeric and oligomeric equilibrium Between mutant SOD1 species in the spinal cord. At the molecular level, we detected an abnormal interaction of mutant SOD1 With the BECN1-BCL2L1 complex autophagy That May Impact stimulation. Our data support a dual role of BECN1 in ALS and depict a complex scenario in terms of predicting the effects of Manipulating autophagy in a disease context. © 2014 Landes Bioscience.;AUTOPHAGY;2014;Artículo;Rheumatology;0;becn;autophagi;sod;mutant;impact;;0;0;0;5;5;5;8;11;2
114;660;Effect of Active Versus Passive Recovery on Performance During Intrameet Swimming Competition;Background: During competition, high-performance swimmers are subject to Repeated physical Demands That Affect Their performance end. Measurement of lactate concentration in blood Indirectly seeks to gauge physiologic responses to the Increase in physical exercise. Swimmers face multiple-maximal exertion During competition events. Strenuous physical exercise leads to fatigue and, THUS, a decrease in sports performance. Hypothesis: Regeneration exercises in swimming Increase the clearance of blood lactate and athletic performance Improve THEREFORE Within a single day of competition. Study Design: Crossover study. Level of Evidence: Level 1. Methods: Of 25 swimmers, 21 Were included, with a mean age of 17 years. They performed exercises That Increased blood lactate on 2 days. The protocol was a warm-up, followed by a 100-m freestyle workout at full speed. Swimming exercises followed That Were increasingly demanding, During Which Were lactatemia serial measurements taken. On the first day, exercises performed Were regeneration on the second day, the swimmers Rested. Next, lactatemia was Measured, and a 100-m freestyle timed workout was performed at maximum speed. Results: The stress exercises the mean Increased lactate concentration by 4.6 mmol / L, Which corresponds to 78% of the initial baseline level. The postregeneration lactatemia level was lower than after That resting (mean, 2.76 vs. 6.51 mmol / L). The time to swim 100 meters was 68.11 seconds after regeneration, while rest That was after 69.31 seconds. Conclusion: Blood lactate levels rose by up to 78% after the intensity of the training sessions was progressively Increased. Increased the rate Regeneration exercises in Which blood lactate dissipated, in comparison With passive recuperation. The rate of lactate dissipation for regeneration exercises was 68%. This factor May Have improved the physical performance of swimmers. Clinical Relevance: Regeneration improved the performance of exercises swimmers in maximal-exertion competition in a single day.

115;2829;Effects of oxygen supplementation on acute mountain sickness symptoms and functional capacity during a 2-kilometer walk test on chajnantor plateau (5050 meters, Northern Chile);Objective: The aim of esta study was to test the hypothesis That administration of low-flow oxygen will improve increase physical performance in subjects unacclimatized to altitude. We EVALUATED the effects of oxygen supplementation on functional capacity and acute mountain sickness (AMS) symptoms in young, healthy male and female subjects WHO performed a 2-km fast walk test following rapid ascent to the Chajnantor plateau (5050 m above sea level) in Northern Chile. Methods: The participants randomly distributed into 2 Were groups ACCORDING TO oxygen supplementation levels: 1 or 3 L O2 · min-1. Within each group, EVALUATED Were males and females separately. A preliminary test was walk Carried out at sea level on a 100-m long, flat track with 10 U-turns. For the first walk at altitude, the subjects Carried supplementary oxygen system but did not breathe the oxygen. Subjects received oxygen through a facemask the following day During the second test. The nights prior to altitude tests at 2,400 m Were spent in San Pedro de Atacama. Results: Supplementary oxygen administration During a 2-km walk test Significantly improved walking times at 5050 m. We Also a significant improvement in Observed AMS symptoms. As expected, however, was Poorer performance at altitude test Compared to values <U+200B><U+200B>at sea level, DESPITE supplementary oxygen administration. Conclusions: Our findings Demonstrate the beneficial effects of supplementary oxygen administration on physical capacity, reducing the incidence of AMS and, THUS, Improving health and safety conditions for high altitude workers following rapid ascent, When adequate acclimatization is not possible. © 2011 Wilderness Medical Society.;Wilderness And Environmental Medicine;2011;Artículo;Sport sciences;0;oxygen;test;altitud;walk;administr;;0;0;0;13;6;13;10;23;26

117;3350;Testosterone Signals through mTOR and Androgen Receptor to Induce Muscle Hypertrophy;PURPOSE: The anabolic hormone testosterone induces muscle hypertrophy, but the intracellular Mechanisms Involved are poorly known. We addressed the question signal transduction pathways Whether other than the androgen receptor (AR) are Necessary to elicit hypertrophy in skeletal muscle myotubes. METHODS: Cultured rat skeletal muscle myotubes Were preincubated With inhibitors for ERK1 / 2 (PD98059), PI3K / Akt (Akt inhibitor LY294002 and VIII) or mTOR / S6K1 (rapamycin), and then a stimulated with 100 nM testosterone. The expression of a-actin and the phosphorylation levels of ERK1 / 2, Akt and S6K1 (a downstream target for mTOR) Were Measured by Western blot. mRNA levels by real time Were EVALUATED RT-PCR. Myotube size and sarcomerization by confocal microscopy Were Determined. Inhibition of AR was Assessed by bicalutamide. RESULTS: Testosterone-induced myotube hypertrophy was Assessed as myotube Increased cross-sectional area (CSA) and a-actin mRNA Increased and a-actin protein levels, with no changes in mRNA expression of atrogenes (MAFbx and MuRF-1). Morphological development of myotubes myotube sarcomeres was evident in testosterone-stimulated. Known signaling pathways hypertrophy Were Studied at short times: ERK1 / 2 and Akt Showed an Increase in phosphorylation status after testosterone at 5 and 15 stimulus min, respectively. S6K1 was phosphorylated at 60 min. This response was abolished by PI3K / Akt and mTOR inhibition but not by ERK1 / 2 inhibition. Similarly, the CSA Increase at 12 hours was abolished by inhibitors of the PI3K / Akt pathway as well as by AR inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: These results skeletal Suggest a crosstalk Between intracellular signaling pathways Involving fast and the AR to Explain testosterone-induced muscle hypertrophy.

118;3595;Cardiorespiratory parameters during submaximal exercise under acute exposure to normobaric and hypobaric hypoxia;Seven healthy young men Were submitted twice to a hypoxia tolerance test at a simulated altitude (3000m). Their first acute exposure to hypobaric chamber was in and the second, in a hypoxic tent. Cardiorespiratory parameters and heart rate variability measurements Were Obtained under hypoxic condition each. A significant decrease of 6% to 8% to the normal oxygen conditions Compared was Observed in arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) in hypoxic conditions Both at rest Whereas exercise led to Decreases of 10% SpO2 DESPITE in an Increase of 27% in respiratory minute volume. The low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF) components of heart rate variability Significantly changed from normoxia (LF: 37.1, HF: 62.9, LF / HF: 1.27) to hypobaric hypoxia (HH) (LF: 49.1, HF: 50.6 , LF / HF: 1.96). However, These Were not Observed changes under normobaric hypoxia. THUS, heart rate variability behaved differently in the two hypoxic conditions, supporting the hypothesis That normobaric hypoxia and hypobaric hypoxia are not equal stimuli to the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. A correlation was found sympathetic and vagal modulations Between in normoxia and SpO2 at exercise under hypobaric hypoxia (HH). Individuals with higher sympathetic modulation (LF%) in normoxia ADH higher SpO2 at exercise under HH (r = 0.808, P & lt 0.05) and Individuals with higher vagal modulation (HF%) in normoxia Showed a trend to lower SpO2 in exercise under HH ( r = -0636, P = 0.125). This opens up the Possibility of using as a tool esta correlation for predicting the personal capacity to altitude acclimatization. © 2011 Consell Català de l'Esport.

120;3928;Exhaled Breath Condensate Analysis after Long Distance Races;The impact of an endurance race on pulmonary pro-oxidative formation and lipoperoxidation was EVALUATED using Exhaled breath condensate (EBC). 3 groups of 12, 12 and 17 recreational healthy runners of Both sexes ran 10, 21.1 and 42.2km, respectively. EBC samples Were Obtained before the run and at 20 and 80 min post run. Concentrations of H2O2, NO2 -, malondialdehyde and pH Were determined. The 10km group Showed no post-run variations for H2O2 and NO2 - Concentrations. The 21.1km group Showed significant increments for NO 2 -, and H2O2 in 20min and 80min Concentrations samples. The 42.2km group, Showed Increased NO2 - concentration in 20min and 80min samples, while H2O 2 Increased concentration only in the sample 20min. In the 10 and 42.2km groups malondialdehyde concentration neither pH nor Showed Differences. The 42.2km group Exhibited <U+0394>H2O2 and <U+0394>NO 2 medians higher than the 10km group. <U+0394>pH mediate Decreased in 21.1 and 42.2km groups, exhibiting values <U+200B><U+200B>lower than the 10km Significantly group. <U+0394>H2O2 and <U+0394>NO2 - Directly Correlated With race time, while <U+0394>pH, inversely correlated. In conclusion, prolonged intense exercise favors the Increase in pulmonary pro-oxidative levels, with no Modifications on lipoperoxidation.

99;220;Effects of Prenatal Ethanol Exposure on Postnatal Growth and the Insulin-Like Growth Factor Axis;Aims: To study the effect of in-utero exposure Alcohol on the insulin-like growth factor axis (IGF) and leptin infancy and childhood During, Considering That children exposed pre- and postnatal May exhibit growth retardation. Methods: We prospectively pregnant women Identified drinking heavily consumed on average WHO 4 or more drinks of ethanol per day (=48 g / day) and Assessed growth in 69 of Their offspring and an unexposed Control group of 83 children, measuring serum IGF-I (radioimmunoassay), IGF-II (immunoradiometric assay, IRMA), insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) (IRMA) and leptin (IRMA) at 1 month and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years of age. Results: IGF-II levels with age in Increased Both groups, but the rate of Increase was Significantly higher in children exposed, and levels Were Significantly higher in ethanol-exposed children at 3, 4, and 5 years of age. In children exposed, IGF-I levels at 3 and higher Were 4 years and leptin levels Significantly lower Were at 1 and 2 years. Showed subjects exposed to much lower Correlation between IGF-I and growth parameters than unexposed subjects. Conclusion: Exposure to ethanol During Pregnancy Increases IGF-I and IGF-II and early childhood Decreases During leptin. The Increase in serum IGF-II Concentrations in ethanol-exposed children Suggests That esta hormone Should be explored as a potential marker for prenatal exposure alcohol. Copyright © 2 S.

100;551;The Alcohol Deprivation Effect: Marked Inhibition by Anticatalase Gene Administration into the Ventral Tegmental Area in Rats;Background: Animals That Have chronically consumed alcohol, and are subsequently deprived of it markedly Increase Their intake above basal levels When access to alcohol, is reinstated. Such an effect, termed the alcohol-deprivation effect (ADE), you has-been Proposed to Reflect (i) an obsessive-compulsive behavior, (ii) craving, or (iii) reinforcing value of an Increased ethanol (EtOH). It Has Been Reported That acetaldehyde, a metabolite of EtOH highly reinforcing, is generated in the brain by the action of catalase. Recent studies show the administration of an That anticatalase (shRNA) -encoding lentiviral vector into the ventral tegmental area brain (VTA) of virtually abolishes naïve rats (85 to 95%) Their EtOH intake. It is hypothesized That antireinforcing the effect of the vector anticatalase will inhibit the ADE Also. Methods: Two-month-old Wistar-derived rats UChB Alcohol drinker Were Offered free access to water and 10% EtOH and 20 for 67 days. Thereafter, the animals Were deprived of EtOH for 15 days and subsequently Were Offered access to the EtOH solutions. At the start of the deprivation period, animals Were microinjected a single dose of an anticatalase (or control) vector into the VTA. EtOH was Measured intake on the first hour of EtOH re-exposure as well as on a 24 hour basis for 7 days. Results: A marked ADE was Observed When EtOH intake was Measured on the first hour or 24 hours following EtOH re-exposure, to the correspondiente Compared controls. The administration of the anticatalase vector reduced ADE by 60 to 80% (p <0.001) on the first hour and by 63 to 80% (p <0.001) on the initial 24 hours of EtOH re-exposure (first and second ADE, respectively ) without changing the overall fluid intake, indicating a specific effect on drinking EtOH. Conclusions: Ethanol intake associated With ADE-to binge-like drinking behavior-is markedly inhibited by the administration of an anticatalase vector into the VTA, Which blocks the conversion of EtOH into acetaldehyde, strongly suggesting That the marked Increased EtOH intake That Follows an alcoholic deprivation period is mediated by acetaldehyde and Its reinforcing metabolite. © 2 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.;ALCOHOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH;2013;Artículo;Substance abuse;0;etoh;intak;ade;alcohol;hour;;0;0;0;12;6;12;8;29;31
101;754;Reward and Relapse: Complete Gene-Induced Dissociation in an Animal Model of Alcohol Dependence;Background: animal In models of continuous Alcohol self-administration, in Which physical dependence does not Constitute the major factor of ethanol intake, two factors likely Contribute to the perpetuation of Alcohol self-administration: (i) the rewarding effects of ethanol and (ii ) That the contextual cues exist conditioning Along With the process of self-administration. Present studies are Aimed at understanding the relative contribution of These factors on the perpetuation of heavy alcohol, self-administration, as an indication of relapse. Methods: Wistar-derived rats UChB high ethanol drinker Were allowed access to 10% ethanol and water on a 24 hour basis. In initial studies, an anticatalase shRNA lentiviral vector gene-coding Aimed at inhibiting acetaldehyde generation was administered into the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the animals prior to ethanol access. In subsequent studies, the lentiviral vector was administered to animals, Which HAD consumed ethanol on a 24-hour basis, or a 1-hour basis, the animals after high levels of ADH Reached ethanol intake for 60 to 80days. In studies end, quinine (0.01%) was added to the ethanol solution to alter the conditioning taste / smell cues of Alcohol That ADH animals chronically ingested. Results: Data Indicate That the administration of an anticatalase vector into the VTA of naïve animals blocked reward and Alcohol self-administration, while it was, NEVERTHELESS, inactive in inhibiting Alcohol self-administration in rats That HAD Been conditioned to ingest ethanol for over 2months . The lack of inhibitory effect of the vector anticatalase on ethanol intake in animals chronically That HAD self-administered ethanol was fully reversed When the contextual cues of the alcohol-conditioning solution Were changed. Conclusions: Data Highlight The Importance of conditioning factors in relapse and suggest That only Abolishing or blunting it, along with long-lasting pharmacological treatment to reduce ethanol reward, May Have protracted effects in reducing alcohol-self-administration. © 2011 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.;ALCOHOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH;2012;Artículo;Substance abuse;0;ethanol;alcohol;administr;self;anim;;0;0;0;2;2;2;8;29;31

Binge drinking from conception to recognition of pregnancy (OR = 1.48 per day, 95% CI: 1.15 to 1.91, p = 0.002) and after recognition of pregnancy (OR = 1.41 per day, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.95, p = 0.04 ) and the total number of drinks consumed per week from conception to recognition of pregnancy (OR = 1.02 per drink, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.04, p = 0.0009) Were Significantly Associated With abnormal child outcome. Conclusions: After exposure to heavy Alcohol Consumption During Pregnancy, 80% of children ADH 1 or more abnormalities associated Alcohol With exposure. Patterns of Alcohol Use That posed the greatest risk of adverse outcomes Were binge drinking and high overall weekly intake. Functional neurologic impairment occurred Most Frequently and may be the only sign to alert physicians to prenatal alcohol exposure. © 2012 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.;ALCOHOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH;2012;Artículo;Substance abuse;0;alcohol;children;abnorm;expos;pregnanc;children;177;0;0.0392635314995563;9;2;16;1;30;31
105;989;Opportunities to use drugs and stages of drug involvement outside the United States: Evidence from the Republic of Chile;Background: Studying youthful drug Involvement in the Republic of Chile, we Sought to replicate North American Research Findings About the earliest stages of drug Involvement (e.g., initial use tobacco and Opportunities to alcohol, and transitions leading illegal drug use Toward). Methods: A multistage nationally representative sample of middle and probability high school students was drawn Youths 30,490 surveys completed Assessed That age at first drug exposure Opportunities and first actual drug use. Cox discrete-time survival models Accommodate the complex sample design and Provide transition probability estimates. Results: An Estimated 39% of the students an opportunity to use ADH cannabis, and 70% of These transitioned to current cannabis use. The probability of cannabis use and the conditional probability of cannabis use (Given opportunity) are greater for users of alcohol, only, only tobacco, and alcohol, tobacco plus, as Compared to non-users of alcohol, and tobacco. Male-female Differences in cannabis use Were traced back to male-female Differences in drug exposure opportunities. Conclusion: In Chile as in North America, When cannabis use Follows Alcohol and tobacco use, the mechanism May be Understood in two parts: users of Alcohol and tobacco are more likely to Have Opportunities to try cannabis, and eleven the opportunity OCCURS, They are more likely to use cannabis. Male-female Differences do not seem to be operative That Governs Within the transition mechanism to use, eleven the chance to use cannabis has occurred. © 2009.;DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE;2009;Artículo;Substance abuse;0;cannabi;opportun;alcohol;drug;tobacco;;0;0;0;12;2;12;1;28;22
106;1011;The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) as a screening instrument for adolescents;Background: The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) is an international screening instrument employed extensively in adult target groups. However, there is scarce information on the AUDIT screening in adolescent With Populations. The purpose of this study was to determine the cut-off point for hazardous, harmful, and dependent Alcohol use through the validation of the AUDIT in a Chilean adolescent sample. Methods: The Original Inglés version of the AUDIT was translated into Spanish, using the procedure recommended by the World Health Organization. The text was then a back-translated and sent to one of the original the authors (Thomas Babor), WHO approved the translation. Students attending public schools in Santiago, Chile, self-administered the AUDIT, and older than 15 years Those completed the Composite International Diagnostic Interview-Substance Abuse Module (CIDI-SAM), Which served as a gold standard. Between 1 and 4 weeks after the CIDI-SAM, participants answered a second AUDIT. Results: A total number of 42 female and 53 male adolescents (mean age: 15.9 [SD = 1.2]) completed the AUDIT, with a mean score of 4.3. Reliability Cronbach's alpha ACCORDING TO was 0.83. Test-retest correlation was satisfactory Present (intra-class correlation 0.81 [95% CI 0.73 to 0.87]). Analysis of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve yielded cut-off points for hazardous, harmful, and dependent use of alcohol, 3, 5, and 7 points, respectively. Conclusions: The Chilean version of the AUDIT is a valid and reliable tool for adolescents With Identifying hazardous, harmful, and dependent alcohol-use.

107;1166;Ethanol as a Prodrug: Brain Metabolism of Ethanol Mediates its Reinforcing Effects;Background: While the molecular entity responsible for the rewarding effects of drugs of abuse virtually all is KNOWN, That for ethanol remains uncertain. Some lines of evidence Suggest That the rewarding effects of alcohol, are not mediated by ethanol per se but by acetaldehyde generated by catalase in the brain. However, the lack of specific inhibitors of catalase has not allowed conclusions to be drawn strong About ITS role on the rewarding properties of ethanol. The present studies the effect on voluntary Determined Alcohol consumption of two gene vectors, one designed to inhibit catalase synthesis and one designed to synthesize Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), respectively to inhibit brain Increase or acetaldehyde synthesis. Methods: The lentiviral vectors, the genes Which incorporate into the cell They carry genome, Were (i) one encoding a shRNA anticatalase synthesis and (ii) one encoding Alcohol dehydrogenase (rADH1). These Were stereotaxically microinjected into the ventral tegmental area brain (VTA) of Wistar-derived rats bred for generations for Their high spirit preference (UChB), Which Were allowed access to an ethanol solution and water. Results: Microinjection into the VTA of the lentiviral vector encoding the shRNA anticatalase virtually abolished (-94% p <0.001) the voluntary consumption of alcohol, by the rats. Conversely, injection into the VTA of the lentiviral vector coding for ADH Greatly stimulated (2 to 3 fold p <0.001) Their voluntary ethanol consumption. Conclusions: The study strongly Suggests That to generate reward and reinforcement, ethanol must be metabolized into acetaldehyde in the brain.

108;2203;Associations between social vulnerability, employment conditions and hazardous alcohol consumption in Chile;Introduction and Aims: Studies from many different Countries Have found associations Between Alcohol use, employment and social context. The aim of study was to investigate esta associations hazardous Between Alcohol Consumption (HAC), social vulnerability and employment conditions Chilean Among adults. Design and Methods: A cross-sectional study, analysis of the 2008 Involving National Survey on Drugs in Chile, was Conducted on 8316 economically active men and women aged between 18 and 65 years, WHO completed the Alcohol section of the survey. Were the participants selected randomly and Data Collected through face-to-face interviews. Multilevel analysis was used to Achieve the study's Objectives. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test was used to define HAC. Results: There Were no significant associations Between HAC and employment status or occupational category confounders When controlling for potential. Using the social services sector, as a reference, the adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of HAC was 2.60 (1.96-3.46) for Those Who worked in construction, 2.03 (1.43-2.89) in mining, in agriculture 1.74 (1.16- 2.63) and in industry (1.26-2.39) 1.73 (1.31-2.28) in trade, 1.67 (1.29-2.16) in other services and 1.42 (1.01-2.00) in transport. There was no association Between the socioeconomic status of the participant's neighborhood and HAC in the fully adjusted model. The perception of neighborhood security (third quartile of insecurity) was associated With HAC (odds ratio 1.22 95% confidence interval 1.02-1.46). Discussion and Conclusions: HAC was Independently Associated With the participant's perception of economic sectors and neighborhood security in Chilean adults.

109;2800;Polymorphisms in mitochondrial genes encoding complex I subunits are maternal factors of voluntary alcohol consumption in the rat;OBJECTIVE: Alcohol is detoxified in the liver by oxidizing enzymes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide That requires (NAD) Such That, in the rat, the availability of NAD Contributes to controlling voluntary ethanol intake. The Ucha and UChB lines of Wistar rats drink low and high Amounts of ethanol respectively and differ in the capacity of Their mitochondria to oxidize NADH into NAD. This function reside in complex I of the respiratory chain and Its variation is linked to genes transmitted through the maternal line. The aim of study was to esta Identify the genetic basis for the difference in the reoxidation of NADH in These nondrinker (ig) and Drinker (UChB) rats. METHODS: Seven mitochondrial genes and genes encoding two X chromosome complex I subunits from rats of Both lineages Were amplified from liver DNA and sequenced. RESULTS: The Ucha and UChB rat lines differ in Their ND2, ND4, Nd5 and Nd6 mitochondrial genes and proteins encoded in the. Most noteworthy are ND2 and ND4 amino acid variations Whose lead to changes in three-dimensional structure models. The ND2 proteins differ in the number Also of Predicted transmembrane domains. The Nd1 and Nd3 genes Have silent substitutions, Whereas ND4L and the exonic sequences of the nuclear genes show no Ndufa1 and Ndufb11 Differences Between the Ucha and UChB lines. CONCLUSION: Amino acid variations in four complex I subunits encoded in the mitochondrial genome May Contribute to Explain the Differences Between ig and UChB rats in Their capacity to reoxidize NADH and in Their intake alcohol, suggesting mitochondrial genes That May Constitute maternal factors of alcoholism. © 2009 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.;PHARMACOGENETICS AND GENOMICS;2009;Artículo;Substance abuse;0;gene;rat;uchb;line;mitochondri;gene;102;6;0.0226264418811003;2;5;2;8;29;31
110;3393;Varenicline and cytisine: two nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ligands reduce ethanol intake in University of Chile bibulous rats;Rationale: Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are pharmacological targets That Have Been Implicated recently in the reinforcing effects of many drugs of abuse, Including ethanol. Varenicline and cytisine nAChR partial agonists are in clinical use as smoking cessation aids. However, Their efficacies to reduce alcohol-consumption Have not Been Studied fully. Objectives: This study to compare the effects AIMS varenicline and cytisine of on ethanol consumption by rats bred for many generations as high ethanol drinkers (UChB). Results: Repeated dosing (0.5 or 1.0 mg / kg / day ip) of varenicline or cytisine, for three consecutive days, to male UChB rats pre-exposed to 10% (v / v) ethanol and water 24 h / day for 4 weeks , Significantly reduced Alcohol intake and preference of ethanol over water and 24-1- During h ethanol access periods. This effect was specific for ethanol intake and was not Observed for 0.2% saccharin or water consumption. Varenicline Appears to be more effective than cytisine, probably due to more pro ITS pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties. Long-term use of Both nAChRs ligands for more than 8-10 days induced tolerance to ethanol Their effects on consumption. Conclusions: This preclinical study in rats UChB Demonstrated varenicline and cytisine That Both Alcohol intake reduces, with varenicline producing a greater and longer-lasting reduction than cytisine. However, dose adjustment will Have to be Considered as a possible way to counter tolerance Arising after continued use. © 2 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.;PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY;2013;Artículo;Substance abuse;0;ethanol;cytisin;vareniclin;consumpt;alcohol;;0;0;0;2;2;2;8;29;31
111;3729;Fenofibrate - A lipid-lowering drug - Reduces voluntary alcohol drinking in rats;The administration of disulfiram raises blood acetaldehyde levels When ethanol is ingested, leading to an aversion to alcohol. This study was Aimed at Assessing the effect of fenofibrate on voluntary ethanol intake in rats. Fenofibrate you reduce blood triglyceride levels by Increasing fatty acid oxidation by liver peroxisomes, Along With an Increase in the activity of catalase, Which can oxidize ethanol to acetaldehyde. Were allowed UChB drinker rats to consume alcohol 10% v / v for 60 days freely, until, at around 7g consumption stabilized ethanol / kg / 24h. About 1-1.2g ethanol / kg of esta intake is consumed in the first 2 hours of darkness of the circadian cycle. Fenofibrate subsequently administered (50mg / kg / day by mouth [p.o.]) for 14 days led to a 60-70% (p <0.001) reduction of 24-h ethanol consumption. When ethanol intake was determined to the first 2h of Within darkness, the reduction was 85-90% (p <0.001). We determined to animals chronically Whether allowed access to ethanol and subsequently Treated With fenofibrate, would a) Increase catalase activity liver, and b) Increase blood acetaldehyde levels after 24-h ethanol deprivation and the subsequent administration of 1g ethanol / kg. The oral administration of 1g ethanol / kg produced a rapid Increase in blood (blood) acetaldehyde in fenofibrate-treated animals versus controls Present administered 1 g / kg ethanol (70µM vs. 7µM p <0.001). Liver catalase activity following fenofibrate treatment was 3-fold Increased (p <0.01). Other hepatic enzymes responsible for the metabolism of ethanol (alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase) Remained unchanged. No liver damage was induced, as Measured by pyruvic transaminase serum glutamic-(GPT) activity. The effect of fenofibrate in reducing Alcohol intake was fully reversible. Overall, in rats allowed chronic ethanol intake, by mouth (p.o.) administration fenofibrate catalase activity Increased liver and reduced voluntary ethanol intake. The administration of 1g ethanol / kg (p.o.) to animals Increased blood acetaldehyde These levels in fenofibrate-treated animals, suggesting the possible basis for the reduction in ethanol intake. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.;ALCOHOL;2014;Artículo;Substance abuse;0;ethanol;fenofibr;intak;blood;acetaldehyd;blood;61;11;0.0135314995563443;2;2;2;8;29;31
112;3964;Place conditioning with ethanol in rats bred for high (UChB) and low (UChA) voluntary alcohol drinking;The main goal was to study de este investigate the ability of an ethanol dose (1 g / kg) administered intraperitoneally to induce conditioned place preference (CPP) and / or conditioned place aversion (CPA) in two lines of rats selectively bred for Their high (UChB) or low (ig) voluntary ethanol intake. It was found That five pairings With ethanol induced CPA in ethanol-naïve rats of Both lines, but the magnitude of avoidance was lower in the UChB relative to the Ucha rats, indicating That ethanol was less aversive to naïve rats bred for high alcohol-drinking. After 2 months of high voluntary ethanol drinking (~6-7. G / kg / day), in free choice Between 10% ethanol and water, ethanol produced CPP in UChB rats, reflecting That ethanol ADH rewarding to Become These rats. By contrast, the low voluntary ethanol intake (<1. G / kg / day) displayed by ig rats preexposed for 2 months in free choice did not change ethanol-induced CPA. However, preexposure of rats to forced ig drinking ethanol (~5.7. G / kg / day) and the inhibition of ethanol-later derived by 4-methylpyrazole acetaldehyde (10 mg / kg intraperitoneal), an inhibitor of the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase, not only Increased Their voluntary ethanol intake in free choice, but Also had a Facilitating effect on the development of CPP. Taken together, These results show That the expression of the reinforcing effects of ethanol required a period of voluntary ethanol intake in UChB rats, Whereas in Ucha rats, Both prior exposure to forced ethanol drinking and reduction of high blood ethanol-derived acetaldehyde Were required. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.;ALCOHOL;2011;Artículo;Substance abuse;0;ethanol;rat;voluntari;drink;high;rat;45;20;0.00998225377107365;2;2;2;8;29;31

65;393;Ex vivo method to visualize and quantify vascular networks in native and tissue engineered skin;Background and AIMS: Neovascularization plays a pivotal role in tissue engineering and tissue regeneration. However, reliable technologies to visualize and quantify blood vessel networks in target tissue areas are still pending. In This work, we introduced new method Which Allows Comparing vascularization levels in the normal and tissue-engineered skin. Materials and Methods: Normal skin was isolated, and vascular regeneration dermal tissue was Analyzed based on transillumination and digital computerized segmentation. For tissue-engineered skin, a skin full bilateral defect was created in a nude mouse model and then a covered with a commercially available scaffold for dermal regeneration. After 3 weeks, the whole skin (including scaffold for dermal regeneration) was harvested, and vascularization levels Were Analyzed. Results: The blood vessel network in the skin was better than Visualized by transillumination by radio angiographic studies, the gold standard for angiographies. After visualization, the whole vascular network was an excellent showing digitally segmented With the Original overlapping pictures. Quantification over the segmented picture was digitally performed, and an index of vascularization area (VAI) and length (VLI) of the vessel network in target tissues was Obtained. VAI / VLI ratio was Calculated to Obtain the vessel size index. Conclusions: We present a new technique Which has advantages Compared to others Several, as animals do not require intravascular perfusions, all areas of interest can be quantitatively Analyzed at once, and the same target tissue can be processed for further experimental analysis. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.;LANGENBECKS ARCHIVES OF SURGERY;2009;Artículo;Surgery;0;tissu;skin;vascular;network;regener;;0;0;0;8;6;12;7;26;36
66;394;Simplified Azygos Anterior Cerebral Bypass: Y-Shaped Superficial Temporal Artery Interposition Graft From A2 With Double Reimplantation of Pericallosal Arteries: Technical Case Report;BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE :: Trapping With distal revascularization is a therapeutic option for giant aneurysms That can not be clipped or coiled. Such lesions in skull basis as meningiomas, arterial encasement is present Often, Requiring, in some cases, revascularization procedures: extracranial-to-intracranial bypass and more recently intracranial-to-intracranial techniques. These techniques are used only in exceptional cases of tumors in other localizations. CLINICAL PRESENTATION :: We report a case of a recurrent malignant meningioma frontal falx With pericallosal encasement of Both arteries (PcaAs). During resection of the lesion, the left PCAA was sectioned and the right PCAA was occluded for manipulation and coagulation of the tumor. The occlusion was diagnosed With videoangiography indocyanine green. A Y-shaped superficial temporal artery graft was Obtained in the right side, and the anterior cerebral artery circulation was reconstructed using an intracranial-to-intracranial bypass in the following fashion: right A2 surface to temporal artery Y-shaped graft for Both PcaAs. The patient's postoperative period was uneventful With no deficit, and the computed tomography angiography Showed the preservation of Both PcaAs. CONCLUSION :: To the best of our knowledge, This microsurgical reconstruction of the PcaAs has not performed Been before in a meningioma or a complex aneurysm case. We think the use of a superficial temporal artery as an in situ graft is more straightforward Compared With Other interposition grafts radial artery: such as the saphenous vein graft or graft. The use of intracranial-to-intracranial techniques is the proper evolution of the use of classic extracranial-intracranial brain-to revascularization techniques.

68;449;The Endoscopic Hemi-Transseptal Approach to the Sella Turcica: Operative Technique and Case-Control Study;Background The hemi-transseptal (Hemi-T) approach was developed to Facilitate a two-surgeon binasal endoscopic approach for sealing tumors, with preservation of the nasoseptal flap and selective mobilization for reconstruction. Methods A retrospective case-control study was performed Comparing the Hemi-T with previously used methods Approach with exposure of sealing and reconstruction. Outcome Measures included operative time and postoperative nasal morbidity. Results A total number of 23 Patients underwent the Hemi-T approach versus 42 in Whom traditional exposure was performed. Operative time was shorter using the Hemi Significantly-T technique (152.6 ± 56.8 versus 205.2 ± 61.3 minutes p = 0.001), as was the length of hospital stay (3.3 ± 1.9 versus 5.4 ± 3.6 days p = 0.004). There was no difference in the rates of intraoperative or postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leak, cartilage necrosis, septal perforation, or mucosal adhesions. Conclusion The Hemi-T approach binasal Facilitates two-surgeon access to the seals without compromise of the pedicle During the extended sphenoidotomies and tumor removal.

70;545;Incidence of Anastomotic Strictures after Gastric Bypass: A Prospective Consecutive Routine Endoscopic Study 1 Month and 17 Months After Surgery in 441 Patients with Morbid Obesity;Background: anastomotic stricture after gastric bypass for morbid obesity Has Been Reported as The most frequent complication after surgery. The objective of esta study is to determine in a prospective and consecutive endoscopic evaluation the true incidence of early and late esta complication after gastric bypass. Methods: A total number of 441 morbidly obese Were Patients Included in this prospective study. They Were 358 women and 97 men, with a mean age of 41 years and a mean body mass index of 43 kg / m2. In all an endoscopic evaluation was performed 1 month after surgery, Which was Repeated in 315 Patients (71.6%) 17 months after surgery, independent of the presence or not of symptoms. Anastomotic diameter was Measured and strictures Were classified as: (a) mild, with a diameter of 7 to 9 mm, (b) moderate with a diameter of 5 to 6 mm, and (c) difficult or critical with a equal diameter or less to 4 mm. Two methods of dilatation Were employed: the endoscope or Savary-Gilliard itself dilators. Patients submitted to laparotomic resectional Were gastric bypass in a circular stapler 25 Whom to gastrojejunal was employed for anastomosis or laparoscopic gastric bypass to, hand-sewn in Whom one layer continuous suture was employed. Results: One month after surgery, 23% of Patients after gastric bypass open Employing a circular stapler 25 anastomotic stricture presented, being 22% of them critical. After laparoscopic gastric bypass Employing hand-sewn anastomosis, 36% of the Patients presented strictures, being critical 10% (p<U+2208> & gt <U+2208>0.17). Patients With Mild or moderate one or two strictures needed Dilatations. Patients With critical strictures needed three to five Dilatations. There Were no complications associated to dilatation. Moderate and severe strictures Were symptomatic however 29% of Patients With mild strictures Were asymptomatic. Endoscopy was 71% Repeated in the whole group of 17 months after surgery, demonstrating the normal anastomosis in all. Conclusions: stricture at the anastomosis after gastric bypass gastrojejunal is the commonest complication early after surgery. Near 60% to mild stricture present (with a diameter Between 7 and 9 mm), 28% being asymptomatic. This complication is Easily Treated by endoscopic procedure if it is diagnosed early (3 to 4 weeks) after surgery.

71;563;Gastric Leak After Sleeve Gastrectomy: Analysis of Its Management;Background: Bariatric surgery is increasingly being performed and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) has PROVED to be effective and safe. Among ITS complications, leaks are The most serious and life threatening. Methods: The focus of the study is nine Patients underwent SG WHO and developed a gastric leak after surgery. Our data Were Obtained from the clinical charts of the Patients and through Interviews with the WHO surgeon performed the index surgery. Results: Eight Patients underwent at SG Institutions outside while one was operated at German clinic. Three Patients developed symptoms within 5 days after surgery, while the rest 10 days after Were diagnosed from the surgery. A CT scan was the method used to confirm the diagnosis in all patients. The three Patients Who Had a leak detected the immediate postoperative period During underwent laparoscopic reoperation. Among the rest of the Patients, percutaneous drainage in one patient was employed as the primary procedure while the other underwent surgical drainage. An endoluminal esophageal stent was employed in four patients. The leak closed in all Patients With The healing time ranging from 21 to 240 days. Conclusions: Diagnosis of a leak after SG required a greater index of suspicion in order to perform an early diagnosis. Sepsis Control and nutritional support are the cornerstones of esta treatment. Evolution is Characterized by longer periods of time in order That are Necessary to wait Until the leak closes. Management must be tailored to each patient. © 2011 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.;OBESITY SURGERY;2011;Artículo;Surgery;0;leak;surgeri;underw;diagnosi;perform;diagnosi;47;18;0.0104259094942325;11;7;11;7;24;16
72;564;Development of de-novo Barrett's esophagus after esophagogastric surgery in human subjects;Background: Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a standard condition in Which the squamous epithelium is abnormal columnar mucosa by Replaced With intestinal metaplasia, secondary to a long-standing gastroesophageal reflux. , Although there are evidences in experimental Several respect to this abnormal development, no clinical Data has been published before the appearance of abnormal Concerning intestinal metaplasia in human subjects. Methods: In this report we reviewed 3 different clinical studies in our group have shown Which the development of BE in Patients in Whom BE was not present before surgery. Results: Three different esophagogastricoperations Which Have Been EVALUATED produces gastroesophageal reflux Either by resection of the lower esophageal sphincter, or by the increase increasing of duodenum-esophageal reflux by gastrointestinal anastomosis or after antireflux surgery. After any of These operations, the development of intestinal metaplasia of the distal esophagus and esophagogastric junction Takes Time, At least 90 months after surgery. Conclusions: Therefore, in order to Demonstrate the appearance of BE after surgery, it is Necessary a) to follow up for a longterm (10 years or more) and b) to perform endoscopic and histological Several consecutive evaluations. © Springer-Verlag 2009.;EUROPEAN SURGERY-ACTA CHIRURGICA AUSTRIACA;2009;Artículo;Surgery;0;surgeri;abnorm;develop;intestin;metaplasia;develop;57;13;0.0126441881100266;11;7;11;2;24;5
73;818;Effect of Subcutaneous Lidocaine Infiltration on Blood Loss Secondary to Corporal Lipoaspiration: A Prospective, Randomized, Double-Masked Clinical Trial;Background: Lipoaspiration is one of the Most Frequently aesthetic surgical procedures performed worldwide. The use of tumescent solution container containing lidocaine to infiltrate subcutaneous fat before surgery has-been accepted as the standard of care for These procedures. Its objective is to diminish postoperative analgesic Necessities and secondary blood loss, but ITS role in hematocrit reduction is not clear at this Time. This study Aimed to measure the effect of subcutaneous lidocaine infiltration on blood loss secondary to body liposuction. Methods: A prospective, randomized, double-masked clinical trial was performed. Between November 2005 and July 2007, 70 consecutive female body Patients submitted to liposuction as a single surgery Were included in the study. All the Patients Were Assigned to two groups randomly. The study group received tumescent lidocaine and epinephrine solution Containing, Whereas the Control group received only tumescent solution container containing epinephrine. Hematocrit was Measured preoperatively, then a 2 to 4, 12, and 24 h postoperatively. Results: The comparison Between the two groups did not show significant statistical Differences With respect to age, body mass index, volume infiltrated, fat aspirated volume, surgical time, hospital stay, preoperative hematocrit, or comparison of the areas lipoaspirated. The mean hematocrit reduction in the study group was 10.8% ± 2.9% 8.8% Compared With ± 2.6% in the Control group (P = 0.004). Conclusion: The use of lidocaine in the tumescent solution for subcutaneous fat infiltration postoperative anemia Increases Significantly Compared With the results Obtained When epinephrine infiltration is used alone. © 2009 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC and International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery.;AESTHETIC PLASTIC SURGERY;2009;Artículo;Surgery;0;contain;infiltr;hematocrit;lidocain;solut;;0;0;0;8;8;12;7;26;5

76;847;Inflammatory Response Measured By Body Temperature, C-Reactive Protein and White Blood Cell Count 1, 3, and 5 Days After Laparotomic or Laparoscopic Gastric Bypass Surgery;Background: Morbid obesity is a chronic inflammatory condition due to the production of cytokines Several from the adipose tissue. However, what happens With Some of These parameters the first days after surgery is unknown. THEREFORE, the objective of the present study was to determine, through a prospective and descriptive study, the behavior of the C-reactive protein (CRP), the white blood cell count, and the body temperature prior to a gastric bypass and for 5 days afterwords. Methods: A total number of 156 Patients With morbid obesity Were Included in this prospective study. There Were 120 women and 36 men, with a mean age of 41 years and a body mass index of 43 kg / m2. They Were submitted to a laparotomic resectional Either gastric bypass or laparoscopic gastric bypass to a. Body temperature was Measured every 8 h During 5 days. CPR and white blood cells Were Measured at the first, third, and fifth day after surgery. Results: All Patients had a regular postoperative course. Body temperature Showed no change. White blood cells Increased Significantly at the first and third day after surgery but normalized by the fifth day. However, the third day after surgery, gastric bypass laparotomic Showed Patients to Increase Significantly greater in the total white blood cell count as well as in segmented neutrophil cells Compared to laparoscopic surgery patients. Exhibited at a similar CRP was more pronounced Increase and after a laparotomic approach. Conclusion: During the 5 days after gastric bypass, a significant Increase in white blood cells and CRP was Observed.

77;877;Gastric Leak After Laparoscopic-Sleeve Gastrectomy for Obesity;Background: One of the MOST serious complications after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is gastric leak. Few publications exist Concerning the treatment of gastric leak. We Sought to determine by way of a prospective study the clinical presentation, postoperative course, and treatment of gastric leak after LSG for obesity. Methods: From October 2005 to August 2008, 214 Patients With different degrees of obesity underwent LSG. During surgery, each patient received saline With methylene blue by way of nasogastric tube and had a drain placed. All Patients underwent radiologic study with liquid barium sulphate on postoperative day 3. Results: Seven Patients developed gastric leak. Leak in two Patients (28.6%) was diagnosed by upper gastrointestinal tract (UGI) study. Two Patients HAD type I leak (28.6%), and five type II ADH Patients leak (71.4%). Four Patients underwent reoperation. Three Patients With Were managed medically or enteral feeding parenteral the drain was maintained in situ and collections Were drained by percutaneous punctions guided by axial computed tomography. Mean length of hospital stay was 28.8 days, and time to closure was 43 days leakage after surgery. Conclusion: Different ways exist to manage gastric leak, Depending on the magnitude of the collection and the clinical repercussions. When treatment necessitates reintervention and is performed early, suture repair is more likely to be successful. Leakage closure time will vary. © 2009 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.;OBESITY SURGERY;2009;Artículo;Surgery;0;leak;gastric;drain;lsg;treatment;treatment;68;9;0.0150842945874002;11;7;11;2;24;16
78;973;Scintigraphic Evaluation of Gastric Emptying in Obese Patients Submitted to Sleeve Gastrectomy Compared to Normal Subjects;Background: Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) has-been accepted as an option for surgical treatment for obesity. This operation Engine Could be Associated With gastric dysfunction and abnormal gastric emptying. The purpose of this prospective study is to present the results of gastric emptying to liquids and solids using scintigraphy in Patients underwent SG WHO Compared to the normal subjects. Methods: Twenty obese Patients submitted to laparoscopic Were SG and Were Compared To 18 Normal subjects. Gastric emptying of liquids and solids was Measured by scintigraphic technique. Results Were Expressed as gastric emptying half time of the percentage of retention and at 20, 30, and 60 min for liquids and at 60, 90, and 120 min for solids. Results: In the group of operated Patients, 70% of them (n = 14) presented accelerated emptying for liquids and 75% (n = 15) for solids to 22.2% and Compared 27.7%, respectively, in the Control group. The half time of gastric emptying (T 1/2) In Patients submitted to SG for liquids and solids Both Were significantly more accelerated Control Compared To the group (34.9 ± 24.6 vs 13.6 ± 11.9 min for liquids and 78 ± 38.3 vs 15.01 ± 18.77 min for solids p & lt 0.01). The gastric emptying for liquids Expressed as the percentage of retention at 20, 30, and 60 min was 30.0 ± 0.25% 15.4 ± 0.18%, and 5.7 ± 0.10%, respectively, in operated Patients, Significantly less than the subjects control (p & lt 0.001).

79;974;Evaluation of the Radiological Gastric Capacity and Evolution of the BMI 2-3 Years After Sleeve Gastrectomy;Background: Sleeve gastrectomy is a restrictive procedure for treatment of obese Patients With different body mass index (BMI) and presents good results in terms of a reduction of percentage of excess weight loss and BMI. There is no consensus Which is the optimal technique to the diameter of Regarding the gastric tube, but a capacity of 100-120 ml Has Been Suggested. In This prospective study, we compare the gastric capacity EVALUATED With barium sulfate or computer-aided tomography (CAT) scan early and 24 months after operation Compared to the changes in body weight and BMI reduction in a small group of 15 consecutive Patients submitted to sleeve gastrectomy. Methods: Fifteen Patients submitted to successive obese laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy Were included. They Were Studied in order to measure the residual capacity gastric With barium sulfate and CAT scan early (3 days) and late (2 years) after surgery. Results: The early postoperative gastric volume was 108 ± 25 ml (80-120 ml) and 116.2 ± 78.24 Assessed With barium sulfate and CAT scan, respectively. The gastric capacity at the late check Increased to 250 ± 85 and 254 ± 56.8 Assessed With the same techniques. However, Remained Stable Patients with a BMI close to 25 without Regain of weight At least at the time of observation. Conclusions: Gastric Increase capacity can beat even after sleeve gastrectomy after performing a narrow gastric tubulization. It is Very Important to objectively measure residual volume after gastric sleeve gastrectomy and eventual ITS Increase in order to determine the late clinical results and to Indicate any strategy for retreatment. © 2009 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.;OBESITY SURGERY;2009;Artículo;Surgery;0;gastric;capac;gastrectomi;sleev;bmi;;0;0;0;11;7;11;2;24;16

82;1909;Late Results of the Surgical Treatment of 125 Patients With Short-Segment Barrett Esophagus;Hypothesis: The results of surgical treatment of Patients with long-segment Barrett's esophagus (BE) Have Been Reported extensively. However, few publications refer to the results of surgery 5 years after the fact Among Patients With short-segment BE. This study Aimed to determine the late results of 3 surgical procedures in Patients With short-segment BE by Subjective and objective measurements. Design: Prospective, nonrandomized study starting on March 1, 1987, and ending on December 31, 2005. Setting: A prospective, descriptive study of a group of patients. Patients: A total number of 125 Patients With short-segment BE underwent three operations in different periods: duodenal switch plus highly selective vagotomy and antireflux technique in 31 Patients, vagotomy partial plus gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y loop With antireflux surgery in 58 Patients, Nissen fundoplication and laparoscopic in 36 patients. Main Outcome Measures: Late Subjective and objective outcomes of the 3 different surgical procedures. Results: No operative mortality and postoperative complications only 2 (1.6%) occurred. The regression from intestinal metaplasia to cardiac or oxyntocardiac mucosa occurred in 60.8% to 65.4% of the Patients, at a mean time of 39 to 56 months after surgery. Showed Visick Visick grading grade I or II in 86.3% to 100.0% of the patients. No progression to low- or high-grade dysplasia or adenocarcinoma occurred. Conclusions: On the basis of These results, laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication Seems to be the surgical option for Patients With short-segment BE Because it is less invasive, you have fewer side effects, and produces good results in the long-term follow-up. © 2009 American Medical Association.

Several postoperative complications related to the \in situ\"" distal stomach Have Been described, and few cases of gastric carcinoma located in undetected esta segment of stomach Have Been published. In This paper, we present our early postoperative results in Patients submitted to laparoscopic gastric bypass With distal resection of stomach In Patients With morbid obesity. Methods: One hundred twelve consecutive Patients Were Included in this study. The mean body weight was 112. 15 ± 5.1 (range 78-145), and BMI was 40.5 ± 6.9 kg / m 2 (32.9-50.3). Patients Were submitted to gastric bypass resectional by laparoscopic approach. The operative time was 133.7 ± 29.1 min (range 120-240). Results: Postoperative complications occurred in 12 Patients (10.7%) without any mortality. Early complications Were Observed in 11 Patients while one patient presented a late complication, four Patients Were re-hospitalized, three of them without operation and other four of them Were re-operated due to early (three patients) or late complication (one patient) . One Hundred Patients (89.2%) Were discharged at postoperative day fourth, seven Remained in hospital Patients Between 5 and 10 days, and four after the tenth day Patients due to complications. Leaks Were Observed in three patients. The histological study of the resected specimen was only 8.9% in average. Conclusions: Laparoscopic resectional gastric bypass presents very similarly results Compared to classic gastric bypass, without significant Increase of morbidity, mortality, early and late postoperative results, and THEREFORE, it is an option for the surgical treatment of morbid obesity in Countries With high risk of gastric carcinoma. © 2 The Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract.""";JOURNAL OF GASTROINTESTINAL SURGERY;2011;Artículo;Surgery;0;gastric;complic;bypass;postop;resect;;0;0;0;11;7;11;7;24;16
85;2282;Management of Leaks After Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy in Patients with Obesity;Introduction: Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is a surgical procedure That is being increasingly performed on obese patients. The most frequent postoperative complication is the appearance of a gastric leak. Purpose: To determine the main clinical features of a group of Patients WHO developed a gastric leak after LSG. Material: A Total of 343 obese Patients submitted to Were LSG, two hundred and sixty-two women and 81 men with a mean age of 37.3 years and BMI of 37.5 to kg / m2. Radiological evaluations performed on all Patients Were on the third day after surgery using liquid barium sulfate, as well as to close clinical monitoring to monitor the appearance evaluation of epigastric pain, fever, tachycardia, C-reactive protein, and leukocytosis. Medical or surgical management of the leak Were employed. Results: Fever was the earliest and MOST frequent symptom, followed by epigastric pain and tachycardia. Leaks Were classified based on three parameters: severity or magnitude, location, and time of appearance after surgery. They were classified leaks as early If They Appeared 1 to 4 days after surgery, intermediate If They Appeared 5 to 9 days after surgery, and late 10 days after surgery. The diagnosis of a leak was confirmed with a barium liquid taken orally by six Patients and an abdominal CAT scan With in ten. Surgical management was performed in eight Patients, Usually In Those With early leaks (six patients). Early re-suturing in three Patients was successful however, re-suturing after the third day leaks Resulted in failure. Medical management was performed mainly in Patients With intermediate and late leaks, mainly through enteral nutrition and percutaneous drainage of the intra-abdominal fluid collection. There was no mortality. The mean healing days of These leaks was 45 days after surgery. Conclusion: Close clinical observation Detects leaks early on inpatients gastric WHO underwent LSG. We Suggest based on leaks Evaluating These three parameters: time of appearance, the location, severity and ITS, in order to propose the best medical or surgical treatment in These patients. © 2 The Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract.;JOURNAL OF GASTROINTESTINAL SURGERY;2010;Artículo;Surgery;0;leak;surgeri;appear;earli;lsg;;0;0;0;11;7;11;7;24;16
86;2339;Hiatal hernias: why and how should they be surgically treated?;Introduction: There is controversy in the literature About the choice of expectant medical treatment versus surgical treatment of hiatal hernias, Depending on the presence or absence of symptoms. This study presents the results Obtained by our group, Considering disease duration and postoperative results. Patients and method: A Total of 121 Patients Were included and divided by age, disease duration, type of hiatal hernia and postoperative outcome. Results: In 32% of the Patients younger than 70 years, symptom duration was longer than 11 years and 68% of Those aged more than 71 years HAD long-term symptoms (p <.05). Type iv hernias (complex) and Those With more than diameters measuring 16 cm in the group Were Observed With longer duration symptom. Were complications more frequent in the older age group, in Those With longer symptom duration and type IV in Those With complex hernias. There was no postoperative mortality and only one patient (0.8%) with a type iii hernia and severe oesophagitis required reoperation. Conclusion: We recommend That Patients With hiatal hernia surgery undergo to avoid complications at diagnosis and Risks. Older Patients Should not be excluded from surgical indication but undergo a complete multidisciplinary Should evaluation to avoid complications and postoperative mortality. © 2012 AEC.;CIRUGIA ESPANOLA;2013;Artículo;Surgery;0;hernia;durat;symptom;postop;type;;0;0;0;11;7;11;7;24;5
87;2371;Latest Results (12-21 Years) of a Prospective Randomized Study Comparing Billroth II and Roux-en-Y Anastomosis After a Partial Gastrectomy Plus Vagotomy in Patients With Duodenal Ulcers;INTRODUCTION :: After a partial resection of the stomach, the continuity of the gastrointestinal tract can be restored by a Billroth II Either gastrojejunal anastomosis or Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy. Each procedure Has Its Advantages and Disadvantages. OBJECTIVE :: To determine through a prospective and random clinical trial, the clinical outcome and the endoscopic and histologic Alterations of the distal esophagus and the gastric remnant in WHO Patients received a partial gastrectomy due to distal duodenal ulcers and to Billroth II or Roux-en And reconstruction. MATERIAL AND METHODS :: In This prospective random trial, to all of duodenal ulcers With 75 Patients Were included. A bilateral vagotomy and selective partial gastrectomy distal Were performed in all patients. A Billroth II or Roux-en-Y 60-cm-long loop was used for reconstruction randomly gastrointestinal tract of the. During the latest follow-up clinical evaluation, upper endoscopy and biopsy samples from the distal esophagus and gastric remnant Were Obtained. RESULTS :: There was 1 operative mortality and morbidity 6 Patients Had some. The average follow-up period was 15.5 years (range, 11-21). Patients With Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy Were significantly more asymptomatic and Visick I HAD greater than grading Patients With Billroth II reconstruction (P <0.001). In the distal esophagus, endoscopic findings in 90% Normal Were of the Roux-en-Y group, but only in 51% of the Billroth II group (P <0.0009). Nearly 25% of the Latter group Had the appearance of a short-segment Barrett esophagus Compared with 3% of the Roux-en-Y group (P <0.0001). The gastric remnant endoscopic findings Were standard in 100% of the Roux-en-Y group and in 18% of the Billroth II group (P <0.02). Histologic Analyzes Showed Similar proportions of normal mucosa and fundic fundic chronic active gastritis. However, chronic atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia fundic Were significantly more frequent after Billroth II reconstruction (P <0.008). Helicobacter pylorus was present in a proportion of like patients. CONCLUSIONS :: This prospective and random study Showed That Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy is Significantly better than a Billroth II reconstruction in Patients With duodenal ulcers, through Subjective and objective endoscopic and histologic evaluations During the latest follow-up evaluation. © 2009 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.;ANNALS OF SURGERY;2009;Artículo;Surgery;0;billroth;roux;distal;reconstruct;endoscop;;0;0;0;11;7;11;2;24;16

The aim of esta prospective study is to present the results of 3 to 5 years' follow-up in Patients With short-segment and long-segment or complicated BE (ulcer or stricture) who underwent fundoplication or the acid suppression-duodenal diversion technique, Both performed by a laparoscopic approach. One hundred eight Patients With histologically confirmed BE Were included: 58 Patients With short-segment BE, and 50 with long-segment BE, 28 of Whom HAD complications erosive esophagitis associated With severe, ulcer, or stricture. After surgery, Among Patients Treated With fundoplication With cardia calibration, endoscopic erosive esophagitis was Observed in 6.9% of Patients With short-segment BE, while 50% of Patients with long-segment BE presented With positive acid reflux, persistence of endoscopic esophagitis With intestinal metaplasia, and dysplasia progression to (in 5% of cases P = 0.000). On the Contrary, after acid suppression-duodenal diversion surgery in Patients with long-segment BE, 95.6% more than successful results presented With recurrent symptoms and endoscopic Regarding regression of esophagitis. Regression of intestinal metaplasia to the cardiac mucosa was 56.9% Observed in Patients With short-of Be who underwent fundoplication segment and in 61% of Those with long-segment BE Treated With The acid suppression-duodenal diversion procedure. Patients With longsegment Be who experienced fundoplication alone presented no regression of intestinal metaplasia On the Contrary, progression to dysplasia was Observed in 1 case (P = 0.049). Patients With short-segment BE can be successfully Treated With fundoplication, but for Patients with long-segment BE, we Suggest performance of fundoplication plus an acid suppression-duodenal diversion procedure.;INTERNATIONAL SURGERY;2011;Artículo;Surgery;0;segment;long;fundopl;acid;short;acid;47;17;0.0104259094942325;11;7;11;2;24;5
89;2581;Ten Years Experience of Banded Gastric Bypass: Does It Make a Difference?;Many surgeons support some sort of restriction of the gastric pouch outlet by Placing a ring around the gastric reservoir. Previous studies shown positive results of Have gastric bypass banded (BGBP) however, there are not many long-term comparative studies to the advantage of real-ASSESS Placing a gastric bypass During ring (GBP) surgery. This study AIMS to Evaluate the long-term outcome of Patients subjected to BGBP and nonbanded GBP procedures. We Studied 260 retrospective, nonrandomized WHO obese Patients Patients underwent BGBP and 218 without the ring (i.e., GBP). They Were followed up for 10 years, and the following parameters Were EVALUATED: excess weight loss (EWL), quality of life (QOL), food tolerance, and correction of comorbidities. The study was approved by the Committee on Ethics, and all the Their Patients gave informed consent. There is a significant difference in% EWL from the third year Until the tenth year of observation, with the proportion being 82% versus 63% in BGBP in nonbanded GBP Patients at the end of the study. , Although there was some intolerance to food intake Increased in the BGBP Patients, This was not felt to reduce the QOL. The outcome in terms of comorbidities was not conclusive. There is a clear advantage in terms of% EWL in the BGBP patients. Differences in QOL Were not found in Both groups. Further, selecting the right type of equipment and the right size of the ring is Important to Improve results and avoid complications. © 2011 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.;OBESITY SURGERY;2012;Artículo;Surgery;0;bgbp;gastric;gbp;ring;term;;0;0;0;11;7;11;2;24;16

Methods Twelve female and male 8 Patients, ages ranged from 32 Whose to 56 years (average 43.5), underwent surgery Between April 2009 and September 2012 in 2 centers. Reasons for surgery Were 13 partially occluded aneurysms aneurysms and 7 recanalized. Results There was no mortality in esta series. Were aneurysmal previous five sites communicating artery aneurysms, posterior communicating artery aneurysms 5, three middle cerebral artery aneurysms, 6 paraclinoid carotid artery aneurysms, and 1 in the pericallosal artery aneurysm. A patient sustained a postsurgical frontal Infarction With mild neurological deficit. One of the aneurysms presented With an arterial branch at the level of the aneurysmal neck THEREFORE, partial clipping and packing was required. Microsurgical clipping in the remaining Patients was performed successfully. Eight cases required partial removal coil before clipping. Conclusions Surgical management of Previously coiled aneurysms is an emerging challenge in neurosurgery. Incomplete or ineffective embolizations pose an Increased risk for the patient, surgical treatment Requiring THUS. , Although not advisable, coil removal Might Be Necessary When in the vicinity of the aneurysmal neck in order to place the clip correctly.

Design Case report. Setting University hospital. Four cases participants. Main Outcome Measures Postoperative course after EC-IC bypass surgery. Results In case 1, the parent vessel was occluded postoperatively. The radial bypass was sufficient to replace the internal carotid artery (ICA) flow, and was turned into a prophylactic to definitive bypass. In case 2, the superior thyroid artery was used Because the radial artery was not long enough to reach the external carotid artery. The recipient vessel was modified from the middle cerebral artery to the ophthalmic segment of the ICA. In case 3, the graft was occluded after surgery Because of carotid artery reconstruction. In case 4, after surgery / radiotherapy for meningioma, the patient developed wound dehiscence and was reoperated for bypass occlusion. The graft was weak and bled intraoperatively, without infarction. The first three are intact Patients, and the fourth remains disabled (Glasgow Outcome Scale: 3 Rankin Scale: 5).

94;3963;Philosophy and concepts of modern spine surgery;"The main goal of Improving pain and neurological deficit in the practice of spine surgery is changing for a more ambitious goal, Namely to Improve the overall quality of life and the future of three major actions Patients through (1) preserving the vertebral anatomical structures (2) preserving the paravertebral anatomical structures and (3) preserving the functionality of the segment. THUS, three new concepts Have Emerged (a) minimal surgery (B) minimal access surgery and (c) motion preservation surgery. These concepts are covered in a new term, minimally invasive spine surgery (MISS) The term \MISS\"" is not particularly About one or Several surgical techniques, but a new way of thinking, a new philosophy. , Although the development of minimally invasive spine surgery is recent, ITS application includes all spine segments and almost all the Existing Conditions, Including deformities. Evidence-based medicine (EBM), a term coined by Alvan Feinstein in the 1960s (Feinstein A (1964) Annals of Internal Medicine 61: 564-579 Feinstein A (1964) Annals of Internal Medicine 61: 757-781 Feinstein A (1964) Annals of Internal Medicine 61: 944-965 Feinstein A (1964) Annals of Internal Medicine. 61: 1162-1193), The Possibility of combining emphasizes art and science following the strict application of scientific methods in the treatment of Patients (Feinstein A (1964) Annals of Internal Medicine 61: 944-965 Feinstein A (1964) Annals of Internal Medicine. 61: 1162-1193), Which May Represent the advantages of objectivity and rationality in the use of different treatments (Fig . eleven). However, EBM has many obvious defects, especially in spine surgery it is almost impossible to Develop double-blind protocols (Andersson G, K Bridwell, Danielsson A, et al (2007) Spine 32: S64-S65.). In most cases, the only evidence one can find in the literature is the lack of evidence (Resnick D (2007) Spine 32: S15-S19.), However, the lack of evidence does not mean absence ITS. Only then a, with a rigorous self-analysis, we take a clear path May towards a new philosophy in spine surgery.

41;264;Autophagy Protects Against Aminochrome-Induced Cell Death in Substantia Nigra-Derived Cell Line;Aminochrome, the precursor of neuromelanin, Has Been Proposed to be Involved in the neurodegeneration neuromelanincontaining dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease. We Aimed to study the mechanism of cell death aminochrome-dependent cell line in a rat substantia nigra derived from. We found That aminochrome (50 .mu.m) in the presence of NAD (P) H-quinone oxidoreductase, EC 1.6.99.2 (DT) -diaphorase dicoumarol inhibitor (DIC) (100µM), induces significant cell death (62 ± 3%, p <0.01) Increase in caspase-3 activation (p <0.001), release of cytochrome C, disruption of mitochondrial potential membrane (p <0.01), damage of mitochondrial DNA damage of mitochondria Determined with transmission electron microscopy, to morphological dramatic change Characterized as cell shrinkage, and significant Increase in number of autophagic vacuoles. To determine the role of autophagy on cell death-induced aminochrome, we incubated the cells in the presence of vinblastine and rapamycin. Interestingly, 10mM vinblastine induces 5.9-fold (p <0.001) and twofold (p <0.01) significant Increase in cell death When the cells Were incubated With 30 .mu.m aminochrome in the absence and presence of DIC, respectively, Whereas 10 .mu.m rapamycin preincubated 24 h Addition of 50mM before aminochrome in the absence and the presence of 100µM DIC induces a significant decrease (p <0.001) in cell death. In conclusion, autophagy Seems to be an Important protective mechanism against two different aminochrome-induced cell deaths Showed That INITIALLY apoptotic features.

42;275;Acute iron overload and oxidative stress in brain;An in vivo model in rat was developed by intraperitoneally administration of Fe-dextran to study oxidative stress triggered by Fe-overload in rat brain. Total Fe levels, as well as the labile iron pool (LIP) concentration, in rats subjected to brain from Fe-overload values <U+200B><U+200B>Were markedly over Increased control 6h after Fe administration. In This in vivo model Fe overload, the ascorbyl (A) / ascorbate (AH) ratio, taken as oxidative stress index, was Assessed. The A / AH ratio in brain was Significantly higher in Fe-dextran group, in relation to values <U+200B><U+200B>in rats control. Brain lipid peroxidation indexes, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and radical generation rate lipid (LR) Electron Paramagnetic content detected by Resonance (EPR), in Fe-dextran Supplemented rats similar to values <U+200B><U+200B>Were control. However, values <U+200B><U+200B>of nuclear factor-kappaB deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA NFKB) binding activity Were Significantly Increased (30%) of 8h after Fe administration, and catalase (CAT) activity was Significantly enhanced (62%) 21h after Fe administration. Significant enhancements in Fe content in cortex (2.4 fold), hippocampus (1.6 fold) and striatum (2.9 fold) Were found at 6h after Fe administration. CAT activity was Significantly Increased after 8h of Fe administration in cortex, hippocampus and striatum (1.4 fold, 86, and 47%, respectively). Fe response in the whole brain to lead to enhanced Seems NF-KB DNA binding activity, Which May Contribute to limit reactive oxygen species-dependent effects on the damage by CAT activity antioxidant enzyme. , Moreover, data shown here Indicate That even though Cleary Fe Increased brain in isolated areas Several, This parameter was enhanced in striatum more drastically than in cortex and hippocampus.

These azaspiracids Have now been identified in mussels (Mytilus chilensis) and scallops (Argopecten purpuratus) from two Chilean locations. This is the first report of the occurrence of toxins in azaspiracid These species (Mytilus chilensis and Argopecten purpuratus) from Chile. The areas Studied Were Bahia Inglesa (Region III, 27 ° SL) and Chiloe Archipelago, scallop and mussels Important Both farming areas. Separation of azaspiracid (AZA1), azaspiracid isomer (AZA6) and Its Analogues, 8-methylazaspiracid (AZA2) and 22-demethylazaspiracid (AZA3) was Achieved using reversed-phase LC and toxins Were Identified using Electrosprayed turbo ionisation (ESI) source , triple quadrupole mass to a spectrometer.In mussels, AZA1 was the predominant toxin in mussel hepatopancreas with AZA2, AZA3 and AZA6 present in approximate equivalent Amounts in the remaining tissues, 20-30% of the AZA1 level. AZA2 predominated in the scallop samples almost entirely With the toxin present in the hepatopancreas (digestive gland). AZA1 was only Observed in some of the scallop samples and was present at 12-15% of the AZA2 levels.Whilst the levels of Azas in Chilean samples are below the EU regulatory limit of 160 mg / kg, it is significant That esta toxin is present in Pacific Ocean species.

The Toxicological Evaluation of Realistic Source Emissions of Aerosols (TERESA) Study to Evaluate the AIMS toxicity of primary and secondary PM derived from coal-fired power plants. As a part of esta effort, we EVALUATED in susceptible animals the effect of cardiac electrophysiology stack Emissions on respiratory function and exposure conditions under Intended to simulate an aged plume With unneutralized acidity and secondary organic aerosols (POS exposure scenario). Methods: Rats With Acute Myocardial Infarction Were Either exposed to stack Emissions (n <U+200B><U+200B>= 15) or filtered air (n = 14) for 5h at a single power plant. Respiration and electrocardiograms Were Continuously Monitored via telemetry and heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV), ventricular premature beat (PVB) frequency, electrocardiographic intervals, and respiratory intervals and volumes Were EVALUATED. Similar experiments at another power plant Were Were attempted but unsuccessful. Results: POS exposure (fine particle mass = 219.1 g / m 3 Total sulfate = 172.5 g / m3 acidic sulfate = 132.5 g / m3 organic carbon = 50.9 g / m3) was associated With Increased PVB frequency and Decreased respiratory expiratory time and end-inspiratory pause, but not in heart rate changes With, HRV, or electrocardiographic intervals.

Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to Were Either filtered air or: (1) primary Emissions (P) (2) ozone oxidized Emissions (PO) (3) Emissions + oxidized organic secondary aerosol (SOA) (POS) (4) Neutralized oxidized Emissions + SOA (PONS) and (5) Control scenarios: Emissions + SOA oxidized in the absence of primary particles (OS), oxidized Emissions alone (O), and SOA alone (S). Immediately after 6 hours of exposure, CL in the lung and heart was Measured. Tissues Were Also Assayed for thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). Exposure to P or PO Aerosols led to no changes Compared to filtered air in lung or heart CL at any single plant or When all data Were combined. Increases in POS Caused significant lung CL and TBARS at only one plant, and not in combined data from all plants PONS Resulted in Increased lung CL Only When data from all plants Were combined. Also Heart CL was Significantly Increased exposure to POS With Only When data from all plants Were combined. PONS CL Significantly Increased heart in one plant with TBARS accumulation, but not in combined data. Exposure to O, OS, and S ADH no CL effects. Univariate analyzes of single components of the exposure Measured Atmospheres did not Identify any component Associated With Increased CL.

49;2523;Lipophilic toxin profiles detected in farmed and benthic mussels populations from the most relevant production zones in Southern Chile;Lipophilic toxins associated With diarrhoeic toxins found in chilensis Were Mytilus (Blue mussels) and Aulacomya ater (Ribbed mussels). These shellfish samples from Chiloe Island Were Collected, Southern Chile. The samples Were tested by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS / MS). After the analysis, four toxins Were found: DTX-1, DTX-3, YTX and PTX. All toxins Were Identified by HPLC retention times Comparing Their With Those of analytical standards and confirmed by LC-MS / MS. Dinophysistoxin-1 (DTX-1) and dinophysistoxin-3 (DTX-3) Were the major components toxins Within the mussel extracts. NEVERTHELESS, the Percentages of These toxins Depending on the area differed They Were Collected from and / or the sampling date. The levels detected in Butacheuques Island for okadaic acid (OA) was 267 ± 3.5 mg kg-1 eq OA (p & lt 0.05) and for DTX-3 was 183.4 ± 7.5 mg kg-1 in ribbed mussels. Pectenotoxin (PTX) and yessotoxin (YTX) Were the toxins detected in minor proportions in the toxic profile of the bivalves. The maximum concentration of YTX detected in 85.2 ± ribbed mussels was 2.8 mg kg-1 in Mechuque Island, Whereas the PTX-2 level was 82.0 in ribbed mussels ± 2.4 mg kg-1 in Cailin Island. Analogues of YTX and PTX-2 Were not detected in any of the analysed mussels, Which did not support the supposed presence of isomers of toxins as a result of the enzymatic metabolism of bivalves. This study found evidence proving co-occurrence of lipophilic toxins - like PTX and YTX - with diarrhoeic toxin in samples Collected in Southern Chile, Which is, to date, the more complex mix of lipophilic toxins found in mussels ever samples from Southern Chile. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.;FOOD ADDITIVES AND CONTAMINANTS PART A-CHEMISTRY ANALYSIS CONTROL EXPOSURE & RISK ASSESSMENT;2012;Artículo;Toxicology;0;toxin;mussel;dtx;ptx;sampl;;0;0;0;12;6;12;6;2;20
50;2967;Atorvastatin Reduces the Proadhesive and Prothrombotic Endothelial Cell Phenotype Induced by Cocaine and Plasma From Cocaine Consumers In Vitro;for Objective-Cocaine consumption is a risk factor ischemic vascular complications. Endothelial dysfunction, Although accelerated atherosclerosis and Have Been Observed in cocaine Consumers, the Mechanisms underlying Their pathogenesis are not fully Understood. This study Aimed at Identifying the effects of atorvastatin in relation to a proadhesive and prothrombotic phenotype induced by cocaine and plasma from chronic cocaine users on endothelial cells.Approach and Results Human umbilical vein endothelial-cells Were Exposed to Either cocaine or platelet-free plasma ( PFP) from chronic cocaine Consumers in the presence or absence of 10 umol / L of atorvastatin. Atorvastatin Significantly reduced the enhanced platelet adhesion induced by cocaine That was PFP from chronic cocaine and Consumers, as well as the release of the von Willebrand factor. Atorvastatin Also avoided striking on cell monolayer structure Alterations triggered by stimuli and enhanced Both NO reduction Because of cocaine stimulation through interactions disrupting endothelial nitric oxide synthase Between (eNOS) and caveolin-1, THUS increase increasing eNOS bioavailability. Cocaineincreased procoagulant tissue factor-dependent activity and reactive oxygen species generation Were not counteracted by atorvastatin. Monocyte chemoattractant protein, Although-1 levels Were not Significantly higher than controls Either under cocaine or PFP stimulation, monocyte chemoattractant atorvastatin avoided completely protein-1 release in Both conditions. Platelets stimulated With cocaine did not express PFP or P-selectin, glycoprotein IIb / IIIa, or CD40L and failed to adhere to human umbilical vein endothelial resting cell.Conclusions-Cocaine and patient plasma induced equally to proadhesive and prothrombotic phenotype in endothelial cells, except von Willebrand Factor for release, Which was only induced by PFP from chronic cocaine consumers. Atorvastatin improved endothelial cell function by reducing cocaine-induced and PFP from chronic cocaine-induced effects on consumer platelet adhesion, cell architecture, and NO production. © 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.;ARTERIOSCLEROSIS THROMBOSIS AND VASCULAR BIOLOGY;2014;Artículo;Toxicology;0;cocain;atorvastatin;endotheli;induc;pfp;induc;54;14;0.0119787045252884;13;6;13;8;5;5

52;3181;Route of metabolization and detoxication of paralytic shellfish toxins in humans;Paralytic shellfish toxins (PST) are a collection of over 26 structurally related guanidinium imidazoline derivatives produced by marine dinoflagellates and freshwater cyanobacteria. Glucuronidation of drugs by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) is the major phase II conjugation reaction in mammalian liver. In This study, using human liver microsomes, the in vitro oxidation and paralytic shellfish toxins are sequential glucuronidation Achieved. Neosaxitoxin (neoSTX), Gonyautoxin 3/2 epimers (GTX3 / GTX2) and saxitoxin (STX) are used as starting enzymatic substrates. The enzymatic reaction product end metabolites are IDENTIFIED BY HPLC-FLD and using HPLC / ESI-IT / MS. Four metabolites from GTX3 / GTX2 epimers precursors, three of neoSTX and two of STX are Clearly Identified after incubating With UDPGA / fresh liver microsomes and NADPH. The glucuronic-Paralytic Shellfish Toxins Were completely hydrolysed by ß-glucuronidase With treatment. All toxin analogs Were Identified Comparing Their HPLC retention time with standard reference Those of analytical samples and further confirmed by HPLC / ESI-IT / MS. Paralytic Shellfish Toxins (PST) Were Widely human microsomes and metabolized by less than 15% of the original PST, incubated as substrate, stayed behind at the end of the incubation. The apparent Vmax and Km values <U+200B><U+200B>for the respective formation glucuronides of neoSTX, GTX3 / GTX2 epimers and STX Were determined. The Vmax values <U+200B><U+200B>for formation Glucuronic-GTX3 and Glucuronic-GTX2 Were lower than Glucuronic-neoSTX and Glucuronic-STX (6.8 ± 1.9 × 10-3, 8.3 × 10-3 ± 2.8 and 9.7 ± 2.8 × 10-3 pmol / min / mg protein respectively). Km of the glucuronidation reaction for GTX3 / GTX2 epimers was less than That of glucuronidation of neoSTX and STX (20.2 ± 0.12, 27.06 ± 0.23 and 32.02 ± 0.64 uM respectively). In conclusion, These data show for the first time, direct evidence for the sequential oxidation and glucuronidation of PST in vitro, being the initial detoxication Both reactions for the excretion of toxins in humans These. The PST oxidation and glucuronidation pathway Showed here, is the hepatic conversion of glucuronic-PST ITS properly synthesized, and the sequential route of detoxication PST in human. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

53;3182;Evidence of in vitro glucuronidation and enzymatic transformation of paralytic shellfish toxins by healthy human liver microsomes fraction;Paralytic Shellfish Toxins (PST) are found in filter components endemic bivalves in Southern Chile. Post-mortems analysis of fluid and tissue samples have shown biotransformation of PST in humans. The Gonyautoxin 3 (GTX3) and Gonyautoxin 2 (GTX2) are the major components in the toxin PST profile found in Chilean shellfish extracts, being as much as 65% of the total content of PST in bivalves filter. THEREFORE, They are the major components of the human accountable intoxication by shellfish consumption. The aim of study is to show esta in vitro glucuronidation and biotransformation of GTX3 and GTX2 When They are incubated With microsomal fraction isolated from healthy human livers. Microsomes from human livers isolated fractions Were incubated With GTX2 GTX3 and purified from contaminated mussels. After different incubation times, and incubated samples Were Analyzed by HPLC Extracted With on-line fluorescent detection and HPLC-MS analysis. The results revealed That GTX3 and GTX2, only When They Were incubated With microsomal fraction and appropriated cofactors, enzymatic Transformed Showed to be in vitro. The glucuronidation of GTX3 and GTX2 followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics typical, RESULTING in apparent kinetic parameters of Km = 39.4 ± 0.24 uM and Vmax = 6.0 × 10-3 pmol / min / mg protein. In Addition, the microsomes fraction GTX3 and GTX2 Present oxidized into Gonyautoxin 4 (GTX 4) and Gonyautoxin 1 (GTX 1) RESULTING in 0.339 × 10-3 pmol / min / mg protein. In conclusion, esta study reports oxidation and glucuronidation of GTX3 and GTX2 When They are human liver microsomal incubated With fraction. The metabolism OCCURS via a glucuronidation reaction, the first step of biotransformation basis in human liver. Also Showed That it is GTX4 and GTX1 came by biotransformation from GTX3 and GTX2 in humans. This data confirm human biotransformation found in human post-mortem tissue samples and fluid Described Previously.

54;3617;Investigations into matrix components affecting the performance of the official bioassay reference method for quantitation of paralytic shellfish poisoning toxins in oysters;Significant Differences Previously Observed in the determination of paralytic shellfish poisoning toxins (PSTs) in oysters using AOAC Official Method 2005.06 and 959.08 Were Investigated in detail With regard to possible matrix effects. AOAC Method 2005.06 2-3 times higher results gave the mouse bioassay method than, 959.08, thought to be due Differences to underestimation of PSTs by the mouse bioassay. In order to prove the cause of These Differences large, work was here to examine the Conducted presence and effects of matrix components on the performance of each of the two assays. A range of oyster, cockle and mussel samples Were using the AOAC 959.08 Extracted hydrochloric acid (HCl) extraction method and analysed for PSP by Both LC-FLD and MBA. In Addition, extracts Were by Inductively Coupled Plasma analysed Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) as well as for metals being subjected to a range of nutritional testing methods. Whilst there was no evidence for effect of nutritional components on Either assay, ICP-MS analysis revealed a relationship Between samples exhibiting the largest Differences in relative method performance, Specifically Those With the largest LC-FLD / MBA toxicity ratio, and samples Containing the highest Concentrations of zinc and manganese. In order to prove the potential effect of the metals on the LC-FLD Either and / or MBA assays, HCl extracts of a range of shellfish Were subjected to a number of matrix Modifications. Firstly, a number of PSP-positive samples Were oyster processed to reduce the Concentrations of metals Within the extracts, without reducing the Concentrations of Significantly PSTs. Secondly, a range of mussel and cockle extracts, plus a standard solution of di-hydrochloride saxitoxin Were spiked at Concentrations of zinc variable. All Treated and non-treated extracts, plus a number of controls Were subjected to ICP-MS, LC-FLD and MBA testing. Results PROVED the absence of any effect of metals on the performance of the LC-FLD, showing a large Whilst suppressive effect of the metals on the MBA. As such, the results show the performance of the official MBA is Potentially unsafe for application to the routine monitoring of PSP toxicity in oysters or other shellfish in any found to Contain High Concentrations of metal ions. © 2011.;TOXICON;2012;Artículo;Toxicology;0;extract;mba;metal;concentr;fld;;0;0;0;12;6;12;6;2;20
55;3623;The transcription factor CHOP, a central component of the transcriptional regulatory network induced upon CCl4 intoxication in mouse liver, is not a critical mediator of hepatotoxicity;Since xenobiotics enter the organism via the liver, hepatocytes must cope With Numerous perturbations, Including Modifications of proteins leading to endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER-stress). This triggers a signaling pathway termed unfolded protein response (UPR) That AIMS to restore homeostasis or hepatocytes to Eliminate disturbed by apoptosis. In the present study, we used the well-established model CCl4 hepatotoxicity in mice to address the questions Whether CCl4 induces ER-stress and, if so, Whether the well-known ER-CHOP stress is responsible for effector CCl4-induced apoptosis. For This purpose, we Treated mice with a high dose of CCl4 injected i.p. gene expression profile and followed over time using Affymetrix gene array analysis. This time resolved analysis gene expression allowed the identification of gene clusters With overrepresented binding sites for the three Most Important ER-stress induced transcription factors, CHOP, XBP1 and ATF4. Such result was confirmed by the demonstration of CCl4-induced XBP1 splicing, upregulation of CHOP mRNA and protein levels at, and translocation to the nucleus of CHOP. Two observations Indicated CHOP That May be responsible for CCl4-induced cell death: (1) Nuclear translocation of CHOP was Exclusively Observed in the pericentral fraction of hepatocytes That deteriorate in response to CCl4 and (2) CHOP-regulated genes with previously reported almost With pro- apoptotic function: such as GADD34, TRB3 and ERO1L Were induced in the peri-central zone as well. THEREFORE, CCl4 induced hepatotoxicity we Compared in CHOP versus wild-type knockout mice. Surprisingly, genetic depletion of CHOP did not Afford protection against CCl4-induced damage as evidenced by serum GOT and GPT as well as quantification of dead tissue areas. The result was negative at Several time points Obtained (8, 24 and 72 h) and different doses CCl4 (1.6 and 0.132 g / kg). Overall, our results Demonstrate That all branches of the UPR are activated in mouse liver upon CCl4 treatment. However, CHOP does not play a critical role in CCl4-induced cell death and can not be Considered as a biomarker strictly linked to hepatotoxicity. The role of alternative UPR effectors Such as XBP1 remains to be Investigated. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.;ARCHIVES OF TOXICOLOGY;2014;Artículo;Toxicology;0;ccl;chop;induc;gene;stress;gene;102;6;0.0226264418811003;5;5;5;8;11;14

Cardiac fibroblasts are the major non-myocyte cell constituent in the ordinary heart, and play a key role in the maintenance of extracellular matrix. The effects of simvastatin on cardiac fibroblast REMAIN Processes Previously Mentioned unknown. Our AIMS Were to investigate the effects of simvastatin on cytoskeleton structure and focal adhesion complex assembly and Their relationships with cell adhesion, migration and viability in cultured cardiac fibroblasts. To this end, cells Were Treated With Simvastatin for 24 h and changes in actin cytoskeleton, levels of vimentin and paxillin as well as Their subcellular localization Were Analyzed by Western blot and immunocytochemistry, respectively. Cell adhesion to collagen or plastic dishes coated, in Transwell migration chambers, and cell viability after Were Analyzed simvastatin treatment. Our results show actin cytoskeleton That Disrupts Simvastatin and focal adhesion complex EVALUATED by phalloidin stain and immunocytochemistry for paxillin and vinculin. All These effects occurred by a cholesterol synthesis-independent mechanism. Simvastatin Decreased cell adhesion, migration and viability in a concentration-dependent manner. Finally, simvastatin phospho-paxillin Decreased angiotensin II-induced levels and cell adhesion. We Concluded That simvastatin Disrupts cytoskeleton and focal adhesion complex integrity in cultured cardiac fibroblasts assembly by a cholesterol-independent mechanism and consequently Decreases cell migration, adhesion and viability. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.;TOXICOLOGY;2012;Artículo;Toxicology;0;adhes;simvastatin;cytoskeleton;migrat;viabil;;0;0;0;5;5;5;9;16;10
57;3741;Determination of the variability of both hydrophilic and lipophilic toxins in endemic wild bivalves and carnivorous gastropods from the Southern part of Chile;The aim of esta study was to analyze and determine the composition of paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxins and lipophilic toxins in the Region of Aysén, Chile, in wild endemic mussels (Mytilus chilensis, Antiqua Venus, Aulacomya ater, Choromytilus chorus, Tagelus dombeii and Gari solid) and in two endemic species carnivorous molluscs (concholepas concholepas and Argobuccinum ranelliforme). PSP-toxin contents by using HPLC Were Determined With fluorescence detection, while lipophilic toxins Were Determined by using LC-MS / MS. Mean Concentrations for the total number of PSP toxins in the range 55-2505 Were .mu.g saxitoxin-equivalent / 100 g. The two samples for PSP MOST contaminated toxicity Were bivalve Gari solid and carnivorous Argobuccinum ranelliforme With 2505 ± 101 1850 ± 137 ug and saxitoxin-equivalent / 100 g, respectively (p <0.05). The lipophilic toxins okadaic acid Identified Were, dinophysistoxin-1 (DTX-1), azaspiracid-1 (AZA-1), pectenotoxin-2 (PTX-2) and yessotoxins (YTXs). All analysed molluscs contained lipophilic toxins at levels ranging from 56 ± 4.8 to 156.1 ± 8.2 g of okadaic acid-equivalent / kg shellfish Together with YTX at levels ranging from 1.0 ± 0.1 to 18 ± 0.9 mg of YTX-equivalent / kg shellfish and AZA at levels ranging from 3.6 ± 0.2 to 31 ± 2.1 mg of AZA-equivalent / kg shellfish. Furthermore, bivalves and gastropods different Differ in Their capacity of retention of lipophilic toxins, as shown by the determination of lipophilic toxins Their respective levels. In all the EVALUATED species, the presence of lipophilic toxins associated With biotransformation in carnivorous gastropods molluscs and was not identified, in contrast to the identification of PSP toxins, Where the Profiles Identified in the different species are Directly related to Processes biotransformation.

58;3890;Seasonal variability of Dinophysis spp. and Protoceratium reticulatum associated to lipophilic shellfish toxins in a strongly stratified Chilean fjord;The fine scale the vertical distribution of Dinophysis spp. and Protoceratium reticulatum (potential producers of lipophilic shellfish toxins, LSTs) and Its relation With LSTs in shellfish was Studied in Reloncavi fjord, to strongly stratified system in Southern Chile. Were samples taken over two years from late spring to early autumn (2007-2008 period) and from early spring to late summer (2008-2009 period). Dinophysis spp., In particular, dinophysis acuminata, Were always detected, Often thin layers forming in the region of the salinity driven pycnocline, with maximum cell for D. acuminata of 28.5 × 103cellsL-1 in March 2008 and 17.1 × 103cellsL-1 in November 2008. During the period 2008 to 2009 sampling, blooms of D. acuminata co-occurred With high densities of cryptophyceans and the ciliate Mesodinium spp. The highest levels of pectenotoxin-2 (PTX-2 2.2ng L-1) Were found in the plankton in February 2009, associated With moderate densities of D. acuminata, Dinophysis tripos and Dinophysis subcircularis (0.1-0.6 × 103cellsL-1) . However, only trace levels of PTX-2 Were Observed in bivalves at that time. Dinophysistoxin (DTX and DTX-1-3) levels in bivalves and densities of Dinophysis spp. He was not well correlated. DTX low levels in bivalves Observed During a major bloom of D. acuminata in March 2008 Suggested That There is a large seasonal intraspecific variability in toxin content of Dinophysis spp. driven by changes in population structure associated With DISTINCT LST toxin profiles in Reloncaví fjord During the study period. A vertically heterogeneous distribution was for P. reticulatum Observed Also, Whose presence was restricted to summer months. A bloom of esta species of 2.2 × 103cellsL-1 at 14m depth in February 2009 was positively correlated With High Concentrations of yessotoxins in bivalves (51-496ngg-1) and plankton samples (3.2ngL-1). Our results Suggest That a review of monitoring strategies for Dinophysis spp. in strongly stratified fjord systems Should be Carried out.

The shellfish samples in Chiloe Island Were Collected, Southern of Chile. The amount of Dinophysistoxin-3 (DTX-3) Measured in the shellfish extracts Were above the international average in safe limits for DSP content in the shellfish extracts Analyzed. As internal monitoring of detection and recovery, DTX-1 analytical standard was spiked into DICHLOROMETHANE-clean in order to shellfish extracts calculate the extraction recovery of DTX-1. The average recovery was 97%. From all DSP toxins Analyzed, the hydrolyzed extract samples Appeared mainly in DTX-3 Concentrations ranging from 99.40 ± 1.22 to 257.73 ± 12.46 ng / g digestive-glands. The acyl-okadaic acid (acyl-OA) was detected in some samples Also, ranging from 1.02 ± 1.4 to 3.07. ± 1.6 ng of DSP toxin / g digestive-glands. This is the first report of acyl-OA ever found in Chilean shellfish samples. This data shows That Were contaminated shellfish samples with a complex DSP toxins profile, in Which DTX-3 is the major DSP toxin component, followed by DTX-1 and the acyl-OA as the minor one. The Important findings Showed in esta study are the presence of Both acyl-derivates (DTX-3 and Acyl-OA) Which are the product of a main metabolic biotransformation That occurred inside the shellfish, in order to chelate DTX-1 and OA, transforming them into DTX-3 and the acyl-OA respectively. This metabolic biotransformation must be performed to avoid self-inhibition of Their Protein Phosphatase 2A done by DTX-1 and OA, since acyl-derivates Both (DTX-3 and acyl-OA) do not inhibit Protein Phosphatase 2A. This complex DSP toxins profile and the permanent presence of Both acyl-derivates (DTX-3 and Acyl-OA) Could Explain the permanent diarrhea symptoms Patients Who Have That experience ingested cooked shellfish in the southern of Chile.

32;781;Xanthine-oxidase inhibitors and statins in chronic heart failure: Effects on vascular and functional parameters;Background: Increased oxidative stress in heart failure (HF) leads to inflammation and endothelial dysfunction (ED). Both statins and allopurinol Have Known anti-oxidant properties, but Their utility in HF has not Been Fully Assessed. Methods: This investigation was a prospective, double-blind, double-dummy study, performed Between March 2007 and June 2009. Seventy-four HF Patients, with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II or III status and left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF) <40%, Were included. Patients received placebo During 4 weeks and Were then a randomized to receive four weeks of Either atorvastatin 20 mg / day plus placebo (ATV + PLA group) or atorvastatin 20 mg / day orally plus allopurinol 300 mg / day orally (ATV + ALLO group). Malondialdehyde (MDA), extracellular superoxide dismutase (ecSOD) activity and uric acid (UA) levels, entre otros, Were Determined at baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment. ED was Assessed by flow-dependent vasodilatation endothelial-mediated (FDD), and functional capacity by 6-minute walk test (6MWT). Results: Thirty-two Patients Were randomized to ATV + PLA and 38 to ATV + ALLO. Mean age was 59 ± 2 years, 82% male Were, and 22% Had an ischemic etiology. Hypertension was present in 60% and diabetes in 15% of Those Studied. No significant Differences Were Observed Between baseline measurements and after placebo. After 4 weeks of treatment, Both groups Showed a significant decrease on MDA (0.9 ± 0.1 to 0.8 ± 0.1 and 1.0 ± 0.5 to 0.9 ± 0.1 mmol / liter, p = 0.88), UA (7.4 ± 0.4 to 6.8 ± 0.3 and 7.2 ± 0.4 to 5.0 ± 0.3 mg / dl, p <0.01) and FDD (3.9 ± 0.2% to 5.6 ± 0.4% and 4.6 ± 0.3% to 7.1 ± 0.5%, p = 0.07) With Increased ecSOD activity (109 ± 11 to 173 ± 13 and 98 ± 10 to 202 ± 16 U / ml / min, p = 0.41) and improved 6MWT (447 ± 18 to 487 ± 19 and 438 ± 17 to 481 ± 21 m, p = 0.83), with all Values <U+200B><U+200B>for ATV and ATV PLA + + ALLO, respectively p-values <U+200B><U+200B>are for comparison Between groups after treatment. Conclusion: Short-term ATV treatment in heart failure (HF) stress and oxidative you reduce Patients Improves FDD and functional capacity.

33;1153;Relationship between mechanical and metabolic dyssynchrony with left bundle branch block: Evaluation by 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in patients with non-ischemic heart failure;Background: Ventricular dyssynchrony is a common finding in Patients with heart failure (HF), especially in the presence of conduction delays. The loss of ventricular synchrony leads to progressive impairment of contractile function, Which May be Explained in part by segmental abnormalities of myocardial metabolism. However, the association of These metabolic parameters of ventricular disarrangements With dyssynchrony and electrocardiography (ECG) findings have not yet Been Studied. Methods: Our aim was to determine the correlation Between the presence of left bundle branch block (LBBB) With left ventricular (LV) mechanical synchrony Assessed by multiple-gated acquisition scan (MUGA) and with patterns of 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) uptake in Patients With non-ischemic heart failure. Twenty-two Patients With non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, LV ejection fraction (LVEF) =45% and New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class II or III under standard medical therapy symptoms Were included, Along With 10 healthy controls matched for age and gender . A 12-lead ECG was to measure the length Obtained of the QRS. Mechanical LV synchrony was Assessed by MUGA using phase analysis. All Patients and controls underwent positron emission tomography With 18FDG to determine the distribution of myocardial glucose uptake. The standard deviation of peak 18FDG uptake was used as an index of metabolic heterogeneity. Student's t-test and Pearson's correlation Were used for statistical analysis. Results: The mean age of the Patients With HF was 54 ± 12 years and 72% Were male. The length of the QRS was 129 ± 31 milliseconds and LBBB was present in 9 patients. Patients With HF ADH Decreased uptake LV 18FDG Compared With controls (7.56 ± 3.36 vs 11.63 ± 4.55 standard uptake value p = 0.03). The length of the interval QRS Significantly Correlated With glucose uptake heterogeneity (r = 0.62 p = 0.002) and mechanical dyssynchrony (r = 0.63 p = 0.006). HF Patients With LBBB Showed glucose uptake marked heterogeneity Compared With HF Patients without LBBB (41.4 vs 34.7 ± 10 ± 4.9 ml / 100 g / min, respectively p = 0.01). Conclusions: Patients With non-ischemic heart failure exhibit a global decrease in myocardial glucose uptake. Within this group, WHO Also have LBBB subjects exhibit a marked heterogeneity in segmental glucose uptake, Which Correlates With QRS duration Directly. © 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.;JOURNAL OF HEART AND LUNG TRANSPLANTATION;2012;Artículo;Transplantation;0;uptak;glucos;heart;lbbb;correl;;0;0;0;13;6;13;10;17;20
34;1257;Conversion to Everolimus in Liver Transplant Patients With Renal Dysfunction;Calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) immunosuppressive therapy postliver transplantation (OLT) is Important to reduce graft rejection episodes. However, These drugs show Important side effects, renal dysfunction Particularly (RDF). Changing from CNI to a nonnephrotoxic drug, as mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor May solve the problem. Our objective was to Evaluate renal function (RF) Among Liver Transplant Patients receiving INITIALLY CNI Among Patients With Whom the RDF Were completely or partially converted to an mTOR inhibitor like everolimus (EVE). We performed a prospective study in liver transplant from 2000 to 2009. Patients Creatinine levels and creatinine clearances (Cockroft-Gault) Expressed as mean values <U+200B><U+200B>± standard deviations pre- and postswitch Were Measured using Wilcoxon nonparametric comparisons for tests. Six Patients Were fully or partially converted to EVE. Their mean age at the moment of introducing the new therapy was 52.2 ± 13.6 years (range = 2860). Immunosuppression time prior to switching from CNI to EVE was 23.8 ± 26.6 months (range = 670). Postconversion follow-up was 25.8 ± 16.5 months (range = 842). All Patients Showed improvement in RF. The creatinine level was significant improvement (P = .03) Namely, from a mean of 2.26 ± 0.49 to 1.21 ± 0.57 mg / dL. Glomerular filtration rate improved from a mean of 40 ± 15.13 72.60 ± 03.17 to mL / min / m 2 (P = .03).

36;2216;Pediatric Liver Transplantation Experience and Outcome in Chile;Introduction In our group 1994 Began ITS Experience with pediatric liver transplantation. The Experience Gained During esta period is the largest in the country, positioning the Luis Calvo Mackenna Hospital and Clinica Las Condes as major referral centers in the public and private Sectors. The aim of study was to esta report our experience of our pediatric liver transplantation program During esta period. Methods The liver transplantation database of Luis Calvo Mackenna Hospital and Clinica Las Condes Between January 1994 and July 2011 was reviewed recording age, gender, Indications for transplantation, surgical technique, complications, and survival. Survival rates Were Calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results During the period Described 230 transplantations Were performed in 189 pediatric patients. Fifty-five percent Were male patients. The average age was 5 years. The main causes of biliary atresia Were transplantation (50%), fulminant hepatic failure (25%), and other cholestatic diseases by 10%. Vascular and biliary complications Were the cause of graft loss leading and retransplantation. The overall rate of retransplantation at 5 years was 20%. The technique of living donor was used in 28% of the cases. The 1-year patient survival rate was actuarial 80%, 73% at 5 years, and 68% at 10 years. In the last 3 years the survival rate at 1 year excede 90%. Discussion Our program includes more than 90% of the national liver experience. The incorporation of living donor is a milestone That has enabled us to save many Patients Previously WHO died while waiting for an organ. Its use in cases of acute liver failure have full allowed us to Dramatically reduces mortality on the waiting list.

37;2217;Health-related Quality of Life After Pediatric Liver Transplant: Single-Center Experience in Chile;Introduction Orthotopic liver transplantation is the treatment of choice for terminal liver diseases MOST in children. Currently, the improved survival of These Patients is well documented, but Their quality of life post-transplant is not described. In Chile, Luis Calvo Mackenna Hospital (HLCM) has performed pediatric liver transplantation in children from around the country since 1994. The aim of esta study is to Evaluate our patients 'and parents' current quality of life. Methods A cross-sectional study was Conducted Between July 2 and June 2011. All Liver Transplant Patients Currently in Control at HLCM Were invited to complete the report PedsQL 4.0 (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory). For each group, average score and comparisons Were Calculated was done using Student t and <U+03C7>2 tests. Results Forty-nine Were Patients enrolled. One-third of the Patients Were between 2 and 4 years, one-third Between 5 and 12, and the rest Were 13 to 18 years old. Half of the Patients HAD Their transplants for more than 3 years, 53% Were female, 53% lived in cities far from the transplant center, 72.5% HAD chronic liver disease, 53% HAD received a liver from cadaveric donor, and 21% HAD received more than one liver transplant. Patients under 4 years good health-related Referred quality of life (HRQOL) in all categories. All school-age Patients poor or very poor HAD psychosocial HRQOL. Discussion Our good results in Transplant Patients Obtained under 4 years May be Because the questionnaire was completed by caregivers. The school-age Patients Were in terms of school AFFECTED Functioning, as They Were not able to Participate in all the activities. These findings need to be Compared With HRQOL perception in other groups, Such as Children with other chronic conditions, and EVALUATED With other broader factors, HRQOL as Reported in international publications. © 2 by Elsevier Inc.

38;2218;Pediatric Liver Transplant Outcome Using Severe Hypernatremic Donors;"Introduction Pediatric liver transplantation is limited by donation. In the last 5 years, urgent conditions Have forced to accept Donors transplant teams with minor suboptimal conditions, termed \extended criteria donor.\"" Among Those, the risk of using severe hypernatremic Donors (SHD) for liver transplant is not yet well established. The aim of study is to esta report the outcome of Pediatric Patients receiving grafts from SHD. Methods Clinical records of Patients transplanted in the last 3 years at Luis Calvo Mackenna, Santiago, Chile, Hospital Were reviewed. EVALUATED outcome was in terms of patient and graft survival and complications associated to the donor Potentially condition. Results Five of 33 deceased donor transplants presented With SHD. All transplant recipients Were waiting in an acute condition, one of them in acute liver failure (ALF). No living related donor was available. Donors' serum sodium was 169 to 193 mEq / L before medical management and Between 157 and 172 mEq / L at procurement. One patient died from sepsis related to biliary complications, and the patient suffering ALF developed primary graft nonfunction, received a second transplant 2 weeks later, and recovered to stable medical condition. No other complication was registered in These patients. Discussion Our findings allow us to postulate hypernatremic That May be used Donors deceased for pediatric liver transplant under Special Circumstances. © 2 by Elsevier Inc.

39;3000;Delayed Ischemic Preconditioning Protects Against Liver Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury In Vivo;Objectives: Ischemic preconditioning (IP) affords resistance to liver ischemia-reperfusion injury (IR) injury, providing an early phase of protection. Development of delayed IP against IR injury was Assessed using IR in rat partial liver. Methods: The IP manuver (10 minutes of ischemia and 72 hours of up to reperfusion) was induced one hour before ischemia and 20 hours of reperfusion of. At the end of the reperfusion period, blood and liver samples Were Analyzed for serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), haptoglobin and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) levels, hepatic histology , protein carbonyl and glutathione (GSH) as well as contents nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB), and activating protein-1 (AP-1) DNA binding. Results: The IP manuver Significantly Increased protein carbonyl / GSH ratios (275%), serum ALT (42%), and AST (58%) These changes after 12 hours normalized. Serum AST, ALT, and LDH levels Were Significantly Increased by IR (4-, 5.6-, and 7.0-fold, respectively), with significant changes in liver histology, protein carbonyl / GSH ratio (481% enhancement), and serum TNF a (6.1-fold increase). Delayed IP in IR animals reduced serum AST (66%), ALT (57%), and LDH (90%) and liver GSH depletion (89%), with normalization of protein carbonyl content, serum TNF-a levels, and liver histology . Enhanced AP-1 / NF-KB DNA binding ratios and diminished haptoglobin expression induced by IR Were normalized by IP. Conclusion: These data support That delayed IP Suppresses IR-induced liver injury, oxidative stress, and TNF-a response, Which coincides WITH RECOVERY of IR-altered signaling functions Represented standard by AP-1 / NF-KB DNA binding ratios and acute phase responses. © 2 Elsevier Inc.

18;894;T. cruzi OligoC-TesT: A Simplified and Standardized Polymerase Chain Reaction Format for Diagnosis of Chagas Disease;Background: PCR has evolved into one of the Most Promising tools for T. cruzi detection in the diagnosis and control of Chagas disease. However, overall use of the technique is Hampered by ITS and the lack of complexity standardization. Methodology: We present here the development and evaluation of the phase I T. cruzi OligoC-test, a simple and standardized format for detection of dipstick PCR amplified DNA T. cruzi. The specificity and sensitivity of the assay on blood samples Were EVALUATED 60 from Chagas endemic and non-endemic persons 48 Control and on biological samples from 33 Patients 7 reservoir animals, and 14 in Chile Collected vectors. Main Findings: The lower detection limits of the T. cruzi OligoC -test Were 1 pg and 1 to 10 fg of DNA from T. cruzi lineage I and II, respectively. The test Showed a specificity of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 96.6% -100%) on the samples and to 93.9% of sensitivity (95% CI: 80.4% -98.3%) control 100% (95% CI: 64.6% -100%), and 100% (95% CI: 78.5% -100%) on the human, rodent, and vector samples, respectively. Conclusions: The T. cruzi OligoC -test Showed high sensitivity and specificity on a panel of diverse biological samples.

19;1194;The Interaction of Classical Complement Component C1 with Parasite and Host Calreticulin Mediates Trypanosoma cruzi Infection of Human Placenta;Background: 9 million people are infected With Trypanosoma cruzi in Latin America, plus more than 300,000 in the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, and Japan. Approximately 30% of infected Individuals circulatory or digestive pathology Develop. While in underdeveloped country clubs transmission is mainly through hematophagous arthropods, transplacental infection in developed Prevails ones.Methodology / Main Findings: During infection, T. cruzi calreticulin (TcCRT) translocates from the endoplasmic reticulum to the area of <U+200B><U+200B>flagellum emergence. There, TcCRT acts as virulence factor since it binds maternal complement component C1q classical human calreticulin That Recognizes (HuCRT) in placenta, with Increased parasite infectivity. As Measured by quantitative PCR ex vivo human placental chorionic villi in explants (HPCVE) (the closest available correlate of human congenital T. cruzi infection), C1q mediated up to 3.5-fold to Increase in parasite load. Because anti-TcCRT and anti-HuCRT F (ab ') 2 antibody fragments are devoid of Their Fc-dependent capacity to recruit C1q They reverted the C1q-mediated Increase in parasite load by respectively preventative ITS interaction with cell-bound CRTs from Both Parasite and HPCVE origins. The use of fluid-phase competing recombinant HuCRT and F (ab ') 2 antibody fragments anti-TcCRT esta corroborated. These results are consistent with a high expression of fetal CRT chorionic villi on placental free. Increased C1q-mediated infection is paralleled by placental tissue damage, as evidenced by histopathology, to damage is ameliorated by anti That TcCRT-F (ab ') 2 antibody fragments or fluid-phase HuCRT.Conclusions / Significance: T. cruzi infection of HPCVE is mediated by human and importantly parasite CRTs and C1q. Most likely, C1q CRT bridges on the parasite surface receptor With its orthologue on human placental cells, THUS Facilitating the First Encounter Between the parasite and the fetal placental tissue derived.

21;1310;Reorganization of extracellular matrix in placentas from women with asymptomatic chagas disease: Mechanism of parasite invasion or local placental defense?;Chagas disease, produced by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) is one of The most frequent endemic diseases in Latin America. In Spite the Fact That in the past few years T. cruzi congenital transmission has Become of epidemiological Importance, studies about this mechanism of infection are scarce. In order to explore some morphological aspects of esta infection in the placenta, we Analyzed placentas from T. cruzi-infected mothers by immunohistochemical and histochemical methods. Infection in mothers, newborns, and placentas was confirmed by PCR and by immunofluorescence in the placenta. T. cruzi-infected placentas present destruction of the villous syncytiotrophoblast and stroma, selective disorganization of the basal lamina, and disorganization of collagen I in villous stroma. Our results Suggest That the parasite induces reorganization of esta tissue component and in This Way May Regulate inflammatory and immune responses Both in the host. Changes in the ECM of placental tissues, Together with the immunological status of mother and fetus, and parasite load Jul determine the probability of congenital transmission of T. cruzi.

23;2574;Short Report: Mannose-Binding Lectin and Toll-Like Receptor Polymorphisms and Chagas Disease in Chile;Mannose binding lectin-(MBL) and Toll-like receptor (TLR) polymorphisms and susceptibility May influence manifestation of Trypanosoma cruzi infection. In northern Chile, we Examined 61 asymptomatic chronic Chagas disease Patients With (CD), 64 Patients With Chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC), and 45 healthy Individuals. Lowproducer MBL2 * B genotypes Were more common in CD Patients (48%) than healthy Individuals (31%, adjusted odds ratio = 2.3, 95% confidence interval = 1.01-5.4, P = 0.047) but did not differ With manifestation. In contrast, the heterozygous Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) -deficiency genotype D299G / T399I occurred more Frequently in asymptomatic (14.8%) than CCC Patients (3.1% P = 0.02). TLR1-I602S, TLR2-R753Q, TLR6-S249P, and MAL / TIRAP-S180L did not associate with CD or CCC. These findings support the complement system to be Involved in defense against Trypanosoma cruzi infection and Indicate That Might Be Curbed TLR4 activation beneficial in Preventing CCC.

25;4126;Molecular Epidemiology of Chagas Disease in the Wild Transmission Cycle: The Evaluation in the Sylvatic Vector Mepraia spinolai from an Endemic Area of Chile;The sylvatic transmission cycle of Chagas disease in Chile is composed of wild mammals and insects of the genus Mepraia. We determined to Trypanosoma cruzi infection rates and genotypes in Mepraia spinolai. We Collected 227 insects from two contrasting areas ecologically ASSESS to T. cruzi infection. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -amplified minicircle DNAs Were Characterized by Southern blot and hybridization tests With genotype-specific probes. Infection in insects from the more fertile area was almost 2-fold higher than in the Poorer area. The genotype TCI was The most prevalent genotypes and other TCIIb: such as, TCIId, and TCIIe Were found at lower rates. The areas differed in Their Genotype distribution but not in Their genotype diversity.

26;4237;Transmission Dynamics of Trypanosoma cruzi Determined by Low-Stringency Single Primer Polymerase Chain Reaction and Southern Blot Analyses in Four Indigenous Communities of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Colombia;This study attempted to Evaluate the dynamics of Trypanosoma cruzi transmission in four indigenous communities of Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta (SNSM), Colombia. Low-stringency single primer-polymerase chain reaction (PCR lssp-) of the minicircles and Southern blot analyzes Were used to characterize samples from Patients, vectors, and reservoirs In These communities. The LSSP-PCR profiles revealed a high genetic variability but similarities With Among the parasites present in the samples of vectors, Patients, and reservoirs of the same and different communities. Cluster analysis and molecular of variance (MANOVA) analyzes of data derived from LSSP-PCR and Southern blot Suggest a gene flux Among Populations of T. cruzi circulating in Patients, vectors, and reservoirs. The results support the notion That the domestic and wild transmission cycles overlap in the SNSM, with Rhodnius prolixus as the main vector and Triatoma dimidiata playing an Important role in the transmission of Chagas disease in esta zone, making the control vector strategy by spraying unsuccessful.

27;4252;Congenital infection by Trypanosoma cruzi in an endemic area of Chile: a multidisciplinary study;This study Investigated the prevalence of Chagas disease (CHD) in pregnant women in Choapa Province (Region IV, Chile) and the Vertical transmission of Trypanosoma cruziELISA and IFI IgG for ChD was performed for the pregnant women. PCR was done for T. cruzi chagasic for all mothers and Their newborns. The congenital infection was confirmed by PCR positive serial and / or IgG ELISA or IFA after age of nine months. The placentas of mothers, with and without CHD Were submitted for histopathology and immunohistochemical study. Results: From 4831 deliveries in 2005-2009 with a coverage of 88.6% serological, it was established 147 That cases (3.4%) ADH CHD. More than 80% of the pregnancies had a physiological evolution and 90% of the newborn Were term. Congenital transmission was Demonstrated in six children (4.7%) of the 127 serial newborn Studied by PCR (at birth and / or 3-18 months Between) and / or IgG ELISA or IIF after nine months age. Most cases of congenital Were asymptomatic (67%). The histopathology shows edema, necrosis, fibrinoid deposit in the placentas of 28 of 29 chagasic mothers. In three cases the immnunochemistry Demonstrated a decrease in actin expression in trophoblast cells. In one case congenital amastigote nests was Observed. Conclusions: These results Indicate That T. cruzi infection in pregnant women and Vertical transmission in Chile are still prevalent. For This reason it is Important to propose in endemic areas Control Measures of the country. © Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene 2012.

28;4343;A Monoallelic Deletion of the TcCRT Gene Increases the Attenuation of a Cultured Trypanosoma cruzi Strain, Protecting against an In Vivo Virulent Challenge;Trypanosoma cruzi calreticulin (TcCRT) is a virulence factor C1 complement That Binds, THUS inhibiting the activation of the classical complement pathway and generating pro-phagocytic signals That Increase parasite infectivity. In a previous work, we Characterized a clonal cell line lacking TcCRT one allele (+/- TcCRT) and another overexpressing it (TcCRT +), derived from the attenuated Both TCC T. cruzi strain. The TcCRT +/- mutant was highly susceptible to killing by the complement machinery and presented a remarkable reduced rate propagation and differentiation in vitro and in Both vivo. In This report, We Have These studies extended to ASSESS, in a mouse model of disease, the virulence, immunogenicity and safety of the mutant as an experimental vaccine. Balb / c mice Were Inoculated With TcCRT +/- parasites and followed up to 6-month During period. Mutant parasites Were not detected by sensitive techniques, even after mice immune suppression. Total anti-T. cruzi IgG levels undetectable in TcCRT +/- Were Inoculated mice and the genetic alteration was stable after long-term infection and it did not revert back to wild type form. Most importantly, immunization With TcCRT +/- parasites induces a highly protective response after challenge with a virulent strain T. cruzi, as evidenced by lower parasite density, mortality, spleen index and tissue inflammatory response. TcCRT +/- clones are restricted in two properties conferred by TcCRT Important and Indirectly by C1q: their ability to evade the host immune response and Their virulence. THEREFORE, deletion of one copy of the gene TcCRT in the attenuated strain TCC generated a safe and irreversibly gene-deleted live attenuated parasite With high immunoprotective properties. Our results Also Contribute to endorse the role of TcCRT Important T. cruzi as a virulence factor. © 2014 Sanchez-Valdez et al.;PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES;2014;Artículo;Tropical medicine;0;tccrt;parasit;cruzi;virul;attenu;;0;0;0;6;4;17;4;5;10
29;4348;Deficiency in Mannose-Binding Lectin-Associated Serine Protease-2 Does Not Increase Susceptibility to Trypanosoma cruzi Infection;Trypanosoma cruzi is the causative agent of Chagas' disease, a chronic illness 10 million people Affecting around the world. The complement system plays an Important role in fighting microbial infections. The molecules recognition of the lectin pathway of complement activation, mannose-binding lectin (MBL), ficolins, and CL-11, bind to specific carbohydrates on pathogens, triggering complement activation through MBL-associated serine protease-2 (MASP-2). Previous work Showed in vitro human MBL and ficolins That Contribute to T. cruzi lysis. However, MBLdeficient mice are only moderately compromised defense against the in Their parasite, May As They still activate the lectin pathway through ficolins and CL-11. Here, we Assessed MASP-2-deficient mice, the mouse line only presently Available With all lectin pathway deficiency, for a phenotype in T. cruzi infection. Total absence of lectin pathway functional activity did not confer higher susceptibility to T. cruzi infection, suggesting it plays a minor That role in the immune response against esta parasite.

1;426;Longitudinal FGF23 and Klotho axis characterization in children treated with chronic peritoneal dialysis;Background Fibroblast Growth Factor-23 (FGF23) and cofactor Klotho are key regulators of mineral metabolism in chronic kidney disease (CKD), but little is Known About the Mechanisms That Regulate Their production. This study longitudinal Evaluates FGF23 and Klotho changes of levels and Their regulatory factors in chronic peritoneal dialysis on children (PD). Methods FGF23, Klotho, 25 (OH) vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and parathyroid hormone (PTH) Plasma Concentrations Were Measured During 1 year of follow-up in PD children. Anthropometric and dialytical parameters Were EVALUATED in Addition to mineral metabolism variables. Results Thirty-one Patients under chronic PD Were followed for 12 months. FGF23 mean plasma levels at Month 1 Were Significantly Compared With Increased controls, 215.1 ± 9.4 303.6 ± 5.7 versus pg / mL, respectively (P <0.001). Baseline levels Were Klotho 41% lower in Patients With Compared controls, 132.1 ± 58 versus 320 ± 119.4 pg / mL, respectively (P <0.001), and did not correlate With FGF23 and phosphorus levels. At Month 12, FGF23 (195 ± 300 pg / mL) and Klotho levels (130 ± 34 pg / mL) similar to baseline values <U+200B><U+200B>Remained. Log-FGF23 Significantly Correlated With height / age Z score (r = A '0.38) and residual renal function (r = â' .44), but no correlation was found With serum phosphorus, phosphate intake, vitamin D and PTH levels. The log-FGF23 strongly correlated with Calcium levels at Months 1, 6 and 12, however, was blunted esta relationship if serum phosphorus was> 6 mg / dL. By multiple regression analysis, calcium was the strongest Determining Variable FGF23 levels. Conclusions In This longitudinal study, FGF23 levels are markedly Increased, and Klotho levels are reduced in PD children Compared With controls. FGF23 levels Appeared to be regulated by serum calcium Primarily, showing a significant correlation at each time of measurement. This relationship was lost in Patients With phosphorus> 6 mg / dL. These observations May Have Important Consequences to the therapeutic management of phosphate homeostasis in CKD patients. © © The Author 2014.

2;583;The mini-PET in pediatric peritoneal dialysis: A useful tool to predict volume overload?;Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) in Patients on chronic peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a major cause of death and is closely linked to hypertension and volume overload. The mini-Pet Has Been Proposed as a useful tool to Evaluate free-water transport (FWT) and ultrafiltration across the peritoneum characterize. Regarding Knowledge FWT Could be of great value to predict volume overload in PD patients. Our objective was to study in esta characterize FWT through the peritoneum in children on PD. Methods: We Studied With Patients clinically stable & gt 2 months on PD. Exclusion criteria Were a peritonitis episode up to 2 months prior to entrance into the study and active nephrotic syndrome. 1-h mini-peritoneal equilibration test (mini-PET) was performed With 3.86% glucose. Calculations (see text for full definitions) Were: Dip Na (Na dial min60 - Na dial min1) Dip D / PNa (D / PNa60 - D / PNA1) Total Na removal (NaR = total Na dial 60 - Na Dial1) , ultrafiltration small pores [(UFSP = NaR × 1.000) / Nap], and FWT (UF-UFSP). Peritoneal equilibration test (PET), left ventricular mass index (LVMI, g / m2), daily UF, and residual renal function Were EVALUATED. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to Establish Correlation between variables. Results: Sixteen Patients Were included, with a mean age of 11.8 ± 3.8 years. Free water transport to body surface area normalized (BSA) (FWTn) was 133.9 ± 85.7 ml / m2 creatinine dialysate-to-plasma (D / P) and glucose at X dialysate dwell time-to-0 dwell time (Dx / D0) ratios Were 0.38 ± 0.1 and 0.65 ± 0.09, respectively. LVMI was 46.6 ± 14.8 g / m2 2-h creatinine D / P and D glucose x / D0 Showed no correlation With FWTn, UF, and LVMI. FWTn Showed a significant inverse correlation With LVMI (r 0.58, p 0.02). Conclusions: This study FWT Characterized in PD children through the mini-PET. Left ventricular hypertrophy Showed a high prevalence in this group, and a significant Correlation between LVMI and FWT was found.

4;1134;"Combined Trifocal and Microsurgical Testicular Sperm Extraction Is the Best Technique for Testicular Sperm Retrieval in \Low-Chance\"" Nonobstructive Azoospermia""";"Background: There is no consensus for the best testicular sperm extraction (TESE) technique in Patients with \low-chance\"" nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA). Objective: To determine sperm retrieval rates in an intraindividual comparison using three locations of the testicle With and without the assistance of a microscope (microsurgical TESE [M-Tese]). Design, setting, and participants: A series of 65 Patients With low-chance NOA presenting With low testicular volume (<8 mL) and high serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) (> 12.4 IU / l) underwent trifocal-TESE plus M -TESE bilaterally (four biopsies per testis). Intervention: Sperm retrieval was performed as trifocal-Tese (upper, middle, and lower testicular pole) With and without the assistance of a microscope in the middle incision. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: The number of tubules EVALUATED, spermatogenetic the mean scores, and the sperm retrieval rates Were EVALUATED to determine locations and the use retrieval of the microscope. The Friedman and Cochrane Q Were tests applied to determine statistical Differences. Receiver operating characteristic curves Were used for the analysis of serum FSH and testicular volume as preoperative prognostic factors. Results and limitations: The sperm retrieval success of 66.2% using the combined technique, meaning the percentage of Patients With At least one container containing tubule elongated spermatids, was the highest in the combination of trifocal- and M-TESE (p <0.01), indicating esta technique as optimal for Patients With low-chance NOA. M-TESE and trifocal-TESE alone Were not Significantly better. The mean score spermatogenetic giving the number of tubules With spermatids in relation to elongated all tubules was Significantly higher in M-TESE versus conventional TESE (p <0.01), indicating the superior quality of the harvested tissue using the microscope. These results are limited by the definition of \""success\"" using \""one\"" spermatid / tubule. Preoperatively, high serum FSH and low volumes did not exclude testicular sperm retrieval successful. Conclusions: The combination of trifocal- and M-Tese is the best technique to reach high sperm retrieval rates in Patients With low-chance NOA. © 2012 European Association of Urology.""";EUROPEAN UROLOGY;2012;Artículo;Urology & nephrology;0;tese;retriev;sperm;low;testicular;;0;0;0;4;6;4;7;15;36

7;2281;Laparoscopic partial nephrectomy: A series of one hundred cases performed by the same surgeon;Introduction: Laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN) has Become the first-line surgical technique for the management of renal tumors smaller than 4 cm. Its main advantages are an excellent oncologic Control Together with the preservation of nephron units. , Moreover, it IMPLIES a shorter length of hospital stay, less postoperative pain, and shorter Recovering times for patients. Context: We included 100 Patients underwent LPN WHO consecutively Between years 2000 and 2 in our institution. Aims: The aim was to present our experience and to compare it With the results Reported in the literature by other centers. Settings and Design: This was a prospective study. Subjects and Methods: One hundred consecutive Patients (67 men and 33 women) who underwent LPN years 2000 and 2 Within Were included in the study. In all cases, surgery was performed by the same surgeon (JMC). Data Were Collected retrospectively, clinical and histopathologic Including information, as well as surgical and functional results. Used Statistical Analysis: Statistical analysis was performed using the chi-square test and SPSS v17 software. A P-value <0.05 was significant in all the Considered Analyzes. Results: The indication for kidney tumor was LPN or renal cyst complex in the 96% of the cases. A transperitoneal or retroperitoneal approach was performed in the 62% and 38% of the cases, respectively. The average size of the tumor was 3.3 cm (range 1-8). The mean time was 103.5 surgical min (range 40-204). The mean blood loss was 193.7 Estimated cc. The average hospital length of stay was 50.2 h. Six (6%) Patients HAD related to the surgery complications. The majority (n = 2) was due to intraoperative bleeding. With an average follow-up time of 42.1 months, there is no tumor recurrence up to now Reported. Conclusions: Our results are similar to Those in the international literature Reported.

8;2842;Intraoperative cystography pre- and post-endoscopic treatment for vesicoureteral reflux: Guaranteed success?;Objective: This study was designed to investigate post-endoscopic treatment Whether (ET) is predictive of cystography intraoperative treatment outcome. Patients and Methods: Patients With vesicoureteral reflux diagnosed (VUR) and endoscopically Treated With polyacrylate / polyalcohol copolymer or hyaluronic acid Dextranomer Studied Were Between August 2009 and prospectively April 2011. Slow infusion pre-ET cystography was performed under anesthesia. Post-ET cystography was performed only if the pre-ET intraoperative results Demonstrated VUR. Results: Over a period of 20 months, 23 Patients Studied Were (18 girls, boys five), with an average age of 41.9 months (range 13 months-11 years). Thirty-two renal reflux Units With Were Treated: nine bilateral cases, right seven, and seven left. The distribution of reflux grades was as Follows: two grade I, 10 grade II, 11 grade III, IV grade nine. All injected ureters Demonstrated grade 0 hydrodistention after the procedure. Twelve of 23 of the pre-ET cystography results Were negative for VUR, indicating the sensitivity of esta That test is 47% Compared With the preoperative voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) or nuclear cystogram. Were there no procedure complications. Conclusion: Of all Patients (n = 23), 60% did not Nearly Demonstrate pre-ET VUR on intraoperative cystography. If a postoperative VCUG performed on all HAD Been Patients, more than half would Have received unnecessary radiation. THEREFORE, This study Demonstrates That post-ET cystography does not predict the success of ET of VUR intraoperative. Pre-ET cystography ureteral under General anesthesia before injection, has very low sensitivity, creating false-negatives That May complicate the interpretation of post-ET cystography. We Suggest That intraoperative cystography before and after ET fails to show clinical utility and shouldnt be used to predict the outcome of endoscopic VUR treatment. © 2014 Journal of Pediatric Urology Company.

9;3019;Persistent Vesicourethral Anastomotic Leak After Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy: Laparoscopic Solution;Objectives: To describe Our experience with laparoscopic reintervention for persistent vesicourethral anastomotic leak (PVAL) after radical prostatectomy laparoscopic (LRP). PVAL after LRP is an unusual complication. Surgical repair is uncommon but can be done safely through the laparoscopic approach. Methods: From 2000 to 2006, 391 Patients Were Treated With LRP performed by a single surgeon. Four Patients With PVAL presented and conservative treatment was INITIALLY Indicated. Owing to failure of the initial management, 4 Patients underwent reoperation using a laparoscopic approach for PVAL at 05.12 days. Results: The vesicourethral anastomosis was repaired endoscopically using intracorporeal sutures. Four Were procedures performed, 2 extraperitoneal and 2 transperitoneal, without any complications. The Patients Were discharged 4-6 days after reintervention. Follow-up has shown adequate results in These 4 patients. Conclusions: The results of our study Have Shown That When conservative management fails in cases of PVAL after LRP, a laparoscopic repair of the urethrovesical anastomosis can be safely performed. However, the long-term functional results must be addressed. © 2009.;UROLOGY;2009;Artículo;Urology & nephrology;0;laparoscop;pval;lrp;perform;repair;;0;0;0;11;7;11;7;22;17

METHODS: A total number of 242 laparoscopic adrenalectomies Were performed in an eight year period at our institution. Twenty four out of These Were bilateral. Of the 24 Patients, 22 (92%) Were bilateral and synchronous. Mean age was 41.4 years patient (range 17 to 72 years) and male to female ratio was 1: 2.1. RESULTS: Mean adrenal size was 5.5 cm (range 2 to 11 cm). In order of frequency, pathological finding was: pheochromocytoma, Cushing's disease, metastatic lesions, hyperaldosteronism, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, adrenal adenoma and myelolipoma. Complete adrenalectomy was performed in 36 cases (82%) while in 8 cases (18%) partial adrenalectomy was preferred. Mean operative time was 78.6 minutes (range 25 to 210 min) 79.5 min and being 77 min for right and left adrenalectomies respectively. Mean operative bleeding was 63 ml (range 0 to 500 ml). Only one patient received blood transfusion. Intraoperative complications occurred in only one patient (2%), a small tear in the renal vein was successfully controlled by That intracorporeal suturing. Mean hospital stay was 3.2 days (range 2 to 5 days).

11;3210;Postoperative morbidity of tubeless versus conventional percutaneous nephrolithotomy: a prospective comparative study;Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy (PNL) is an established technique for the treatment of renal calculi. Some reports Have challenged the need for a nephrostomy tube at the end of the procedure, arguing That it accounts for a longer hospital stay and postoperative pain Increased. During the last years, Several series Have addressed the feasibility and safety of tubeless PNL, Where a double-J stent is left in ureteral place after the end of intervention nephrostomy tube Instead of a. The aim of our study was to compare conventional versus tubeless PNL in terms of postoperative morbidity. Eighty-five Patients WHO underwent PNL at a single center met the inclusion criteria (complete intraoperative stone clearance, no evidence of active intraoperative bleeding, single percutaneous access, and operative time shorter than 2 h) and Were randomized at the end of the procedure to Have a nephrostomy tube Placed Either (group 1) or a double-J ureteral stent (group 2). Outcomes Assessed Were postoperative pain, bleeding complications, leakage complications, and length of hospital stay. The Patients in the tubeless group had a shorter hospital stay (3.7 vs. 5.8 days P <0.001), and less postoperative pain at postoperative days 2 and 3 (P <0.001). No significant difference in bleeding or leakage was Observed complications. This study supports the feasibility and safety of tubeless PNL in a selected group of the Patients, suggesting some intraoperative criteria to be Considered When performing it.

12;3799;RENAL CANCER FROM LAPAROSCOPIC TO ROBOTIC: HOW TO PROCEED;The benefits laparoscopic surgery Brings to the table are well established in the literature. In our environment however, still MOST of the reconstructive / oncologic procedures are performed as open surgery. This can be Explained by the multiple challenges esta Involves technique, as well as a demanding learning curve. Technology has provided Means to Improve accuracy and usefulness of laparoscopy, as well as broaden ITS use amongst the medical community by shortening ITS learning curve. Renal tumors Have Been managed by laparoscopic approach for the past 20 years. During This Time, many studies in the literature Appeared esta Comparing with open surgery procedure. In the vast majority, laparoscopic surgery has the upper hand in regards of perioperative events. A number of series are available Regarding the feasibility of robotic radical nephrectomy, however there is no literature available Demonstrates That better outcome of robotic radical nephrectomy Compared to standard laparoscopy. Laparoscopic partial nephrectomy is technically difficult, Which preventer has spread through the massive ITS urologist community, even amongst trained laparoscopists. Current reports are starting to please robotic partial nephrectomy over standard laparoscopy Regarding perioperative outcomes, with a similar oncologic results. Have more studies to be performed in order to elucidate the Importance of NOTES and LESS in the treatment on localized renal cancer, but the use of the robot will lower Their learning curve and probably make them attractive in the short term. Even though technology has esta Brought closer to a laparoscopy greater number of surgeons, physicians Should Become familiar and proficient in conventional laparoscopic procedures before embarking into robotics.;ARCHIVOS ESPANOLES DE UROLOGIA;2013;Artículo;Urology & nephrology;0;laparoscop;robot;laparoscopi;nephrectomi;surgeri;;0;0;0;11;7;11;7;22;17
13;3825;Immediate postoperative morbidity in patients with indwelling double-J stent versus overnight-externalized ureteral catheter after tubeless percutaneous nephrolithotomy: a prospective, randomized study;The conventional technique for percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL) ends by a nephrostomy tube Placing Within the access tract. However, feasibility and safety of tubeless PNL Have Been Widely Demonstrated. In This modification, a ureteral stent is left in place Usually the nephrostomy tube INSTEAD OF. esta ureteral The aim of study is to compare the use of a postoperative indwelling double-J stent versus an overnight-externalized catheter tubeless PNL in Patients Undergoing. Patients Undergoing sixty-eight tubeless PNL Were Either randomized for a double-J stent postoperative (group 1) or for an overnightexternalized ureteral catheter (group 2). EVALUATED Outcomes included postoperative pain, hospital stay length, incidence of hemorrhagic complications, residual lithiasis and urinary leakage. Groups like Were ACCORDING TO age, sex, body mass index and stone burden. There Were not significant in terms of postoperative Differences pain, incidence of perirenal hematoma, residual lithiasis and urinary leakage. However, in group 1 presented Patients longer hospital stays (3.7 ± 1.7 vs. 1.9 ± 0.3 days p <0.001) and greater hematocrit drops (4.9 ± 2.2 vs. 2.1 ± 1.8% p <0.001). Our results confirm That Undergoing tubeless PNL Among Patients, Both alternatives (i.e. leaving a double-J stent or an externalized ureteral catheter-overnight) are reliable and safe. However, further considerations, like the need of double-J stent removal under cystoscopy, need to be taken into account When deciding to use Which modality. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2.;UROLITHIASIS;2013;Artículo;Urology & nephrology;0;pnl;stent;doubl;postop;tubeless;;0;0;0;8;8;12;7;22;23
14;4023;The short peritoneal equilibration test in pediatric peritoneal dialysis;The peritoneal equilibration test (PET) is the gold standard method for defining peritoneal membrane permeability and for prescribing peritoneal dialysis (PD) therapy on an Individual basis. However, it is laborious, nursing consume time, and requires many hours to be performed. THEREFORE, Have Several authors attempted to validate a short PET protocol, with controversial results. To Evaluate the Concordance Between the 2-H (short) and 4-H (classical) peritoneal equilibrium test, a Observational prospective protocol was applied in three PD centers (Mexico, Chile, and Uruguay) between July 1, 2008 and July 31, 2009 . PET protocol: the night prior to the test, each patient received five exchanges, 1 hour each, at the same glucose concentration as used with previously. Afterwards, 2.5% glucose dialysis solution was used for a dwell time of 4 h. Exchange fill volume was 1.100 ml / m 2 body surface area. The next morning, the 4-h Dwell was drained, and Dianeal 2.5% was infused. Three dialysate samples at 0, 2, and 4 hours Were Obtained. A single blood sample was Obtained at 120 min. Creatinine D / P and glucose D / D ratios Were Calculated at 0 hours 0, 2, and 4. Patients Were categorized as low, low average, high average, or high transporters ACCORDING creat D / P and gluc D / D 0 results. Pearson and Kappa test Were used for numerical and categorical correlations, respectively, and p & lt 0.05 was Considered significant. Eighty-seven PET studies Were EVALUATED in 74 Patients, 33 evils, age 11.1 ± 5.05 years old. A positive linear correlation of 92% between 2 and 4-h creat D / P and 80% between 2 and 4 h-gluc D / D 0 (p & lt 0.001) was founded. The Kappa test Showed a significant concordance Between creat D / P and gluc D / D 0 categories at 2 and 4 h (p & lt 0.001). When analyzing cut-off-value categories, creat D / P was founded to be lower and gluc D / D 0 higher than other experiences.

15;4112;Continuous EPO receptor activator therapy of anemia in children under peritoneal dialysis;The short half-life of erythropoietin (rHuEPO) leads to fluctuations in hemoglobin levels Repeated and the need for frequent administration. Continuous erythropoietin receptor activator (CERA) has-been approved for therapy once or twice a month in adult dialysis patients. To Evaluate the efficacy and safety of therapy in the management CERA of anemia in peritoneal dialysis pediatric (PD) PD stable children under twice-a-week EPO Were converted to a subcutaneous CERA, scheduled every 2 weeks. The follow-up was six months. The primary efficacy parameter was hemoglobin> 11 g / dL. The exclusion criteria Were ferritin <100 ng / ml and Hb saturation <20%. Sixteen children, aged 9.75 ± 3.6 years, Including 11 boys, participated in the study. Mean Hb level at month 0 was 10.8 ± 1.9 g / dL. A decrease in hemoglobin to 10.38 ± 1 g / dL at month 2 was Observed. The CERA dose was 0.86 ± 0.33 Increased from ± 1.67 to 0.4 mg / kg at month 3. The target Hb level was Reached by the 3rd month. The Hb level and CERA dose 12.2 ± 1.2 Were and 1.6 ± 0.67 mg / kg respectively at the end of the study. No adverse events Were Observed During the protocol. CERA is an effective and safe therapy for Maintaining hemoglobin levels When administered twice, up to eleven month, in PD children.

16;4230;Early steroid withdrawal in pediatric renal transplant: five years of follow-up;This prospective, comparative trial Investigated impact on the mean change in height standard deviation score (SDS), acute rejection rate, and renal function of early steroid withdrawal in 96 recipients with 5 years of follow-up. Recipients under basiliximab induction and steroid withdrawal (SW: TAC / MMF n = 55) Were Compared with a matched steroid Control group (SC: TAC / MMF / STEROID, n = 41). SW received steroids Until Day 6, SC Decreased to 10 mg / m 2 within 2 months post-transplant. Five years after SW, the longitudinal growth (SDS) was 1.4 ± 0.4 gain vs. 1.1 ± 0.3 for SC group (p & lt 0.02). Height prepubertal and pubertal benefits in status in Were Demonstrated Both groups in the delta growth trends (mixed model p & lt 0.01). Biopsy-proven acute rejection in SW was 11% and 17.5%, SC (p: ns). Mean eGFR (ml / min / 1.73 m 2) at 5 years post-transplant was 80.6 ± 27.8 vs. SW 82.6 ± 25.1 for SC (p = ns). The death-rate at censored graft survival 1 and 5 years was 99 and 90% for SW 98 and 96% for SC (p = ns). PTLD incidence in SW 3.3 vs. 2.5% in SC (p = ns).

17;4556;Genotype-phenotype associations in WT1 glomerulopathy;WT1 mutations cause a wide spectrum of renal and extrarenal manifestations. Here we EVALUATED disease prevalence, spectrum phenotype, and genotype-phenotype correlations of 61 Patients With WT1-related steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome relative to 700 WT1-negative Patients, all with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome. WT1 Patients With more Frequently presented chronic kidney disease and hypertension at diagnosis and more rapid disease progression exhibited. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis was equally prevalent in Both cohorts, but diffuse mesangial sclerosis was Largely for WT1 specific disease and was present in 34% of cases. Sex reversal and / or urogenital abnormalities (52%), Wilms tumor (38%), and gonadoblastoma (5%) Were almost exclusive to WT1 disease. Missense substitutions Affecting DNA-binding residues diffuse mesangial Were associated With sclerosis (74%), early steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome onset, progression to ESRD and rapid. Truncating mutations conferred the highest Wilms tumor risk (78%) but late-onset Typically steroid nephrotic syndrome-resistant. Intronic (KTS) Were mutations most likely to present as isolated to steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (37%) with a median age of onset at an 4.5 years, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis on biopsy, and slow progression (median age 13.6 years ESRD). THUS, there is a wide range of expressivity, solid genotype-phenotype associations, and a high risk and significance of extrarenal complications in WT1-associated nephropathy.
